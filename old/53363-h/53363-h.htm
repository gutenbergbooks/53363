<h2 id="PREFACE_TO_THE_SECOND_EDITION">PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>


<p>The first edition of this work has been out of print for
some years, but nevertheless there is a constant demand for
it, and this together with the fact that frequent inquiries
are received for information in this department of industry,
are the inducements which have led to the preparation of
the present treatise.</p>

<p>The book is arranged in two parts, Part I. comprising
Glue, Gelatine and Allied Products, and Part II. Cements,
Pastes and Mucilages, and it is fully illustrated with engravings
of various types of apparatus.</p>

<p>Since the appearance of the first edition much progress
has been made in the manufacture of glue and allied products.
Old and wasteful methods of working have been
replaced by more approved processes, and in the present
volume it has been endeavored to place before those interested
in these industries, a practical and comprehensive
account of modern methods of operation.</p>

<p>In order adequately to represent this advancement and
development, the best authorities have been freely consulted
and drawn upon, special acknowledgments being due to
the following works: “Bone Products and Manures,” by
Thomas Lambert, and “Glue and Glue Testing,” by
Samuel Rideal.</p>

<p>As the demand for phosphorus is steadily increasing, and
the manufacture of this product from bones and bone-ash
forms an important branch of the utilization of bones, it has
been deemed advisable to devote a chapter to this subject.</p>

<p>The receipts for cements, pastes, and mucilages given in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
Part II. have been gathered from numerous sources. They
have been critically examined, and are offered, with the
full conviction, that they will not be found wanting in
efficacy.</p>

<p>The Table of Contents and Index have both been carefully
prepared, and being very full, will make reference to
any subject in the volume easy and satisfactory.</p>

<small>NATURE OF GLUE.</small></h3>


<h4>1. SOURCES OF GLUE.</h4>

<p>The organisms of all animals, but more especially of the
higher classes, contain tissues which are insoluble in cold,
as well as in hot, water. However, by continued boiling
they become dissolved, and yield on evaporation of the
solution a glutinous, gelatinizing mass. By further drying
this mass exhibits, according to the degree of purity of the
material, a more or less transparent and brittle substance,
which in its pure state is devoid of color as well as of smell;
it swells up in cold water and dissolves by boiling in that
liquid. This substance, <i>i. e.</i>, the product of the conversion
of the so-called glue or gelatine-yielding tissue, is what is
known in the trade as <em>glue</em>.</p>

<p>Among the glue-yielding tissues, the following are the
most important: Cellular tissue, the corium, tendons or
sinews, the middle membrane of the vasa lymphatica and
veins, the ossein or organic matter of bones, hartshorn,
cartilage, the air bladders of many kinds of fishes, etc.</p>

<p>Neither glue nor gelatine exists ready formed in the animal
organism, except under abnormal conditions as a
phenomenon of disease, but they are the products of various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
transformations. The first of these transformations evidently
takes place in drying the hide, since the result of
boiling to glue a green hide prepared in the usual manner
by liming, etc., but not previously dried, will be an entirely
different product of less consistency than that obtained by
drying the hide after liming and then boiling. A second
transformation seems to take place in boiling the material,
and a third in drying the jelly obtained, and this may explain
the fact that the latter, which is not converted into
actual glue, differs in its behavior from glue solution. The
series of transformation does not end even with the actual
glue, for it is a well-known fact that glue dissolved in water
and boiled for some time does not gelatinize on cooling, but
remains liquid. We have here to deal with organic combinations
which are distinguished from the more solid
organic compounds by passing more readily into decomposition.
However, it is an established fact that glue is an
organic combination presenting itself in different modifications.
In the animal organism it occurs ready formed only
under abnormal conditions as a phenomenon of disease, and
hence it is only produced by first drying and then by continued
boiling of the glue-yielding substance, and finally
by evaporating and further drying the gelatinous mass obtained
by boiling.</p>


<h4>2. TRANSITION STAGES OF GLUE.</h4>

<p>We therefore distinguish:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Glue-yielding substance.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Crude glue.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Jelly.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Glue.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The glue-yielding substance of the animal body is
produced from proteïne substances, albumen, fibrine and
caseïne, in a manner similar to that in which new substances
are formed in the ripening fruit by the transformation and
disintegration into constituent parts of others previously
present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span></p>

<p><i>b.</i> By <em>crude glue</em> are understood glue-yielding materials
free from all foreign matter and physically prepared by
drying. It forms an intermediate link between glue-yielding
substance and jelly.</p>

<p>This distinction between glue-yielding substance and
crude glue is justified by experience. If, for instance, fresh
calves’ heads, such as the tanner cuts off after swelling the
skins, be carefully limed and then boiled without previous
drying, the result will be a turbid liquor containing, though
everything be dissolved, no jelly whatever, or at least, very
little.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> <em>Jelly</em> is obtained by boiling the crude glue. Its adhesive
power is far less than that of solution of finished glue,
and it will become more quickly putrid than the latter.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> The finished product <em>glue</em> is, in most cases, not a definite
chemical compound, but a mixture of substances, with
two of which scientific research has made us thoroughly
acquainted.</p>


<h4>3. CONSTITUTION OF GLUE.</h4>

<p>Independent of impurities and accidental constituents,
glue consists of two distinctly distinguishable combinations,
namely, <em>glutin or gelatin</em> and <em>chondrin</em>, the former being
formed from the hide and osseous parts, and the latter from
young bones while still in a soft state, and the “permanent”
cartilages, such as those of the ribs and joints.</p>

<p>The manufacturer has it, of course, in his power to allow
either of these substances to predominate in his product,
but since experiments have shown glutin or gelatin to
possess much greater adhesive power than chondrin, it is
advisable to separate as much as possible the cartilaginous
matter from other glue-yielding material.</p>

<p>As an accurate knowledge of these constituents of glue is
of great importance to the manufacturer, brief reference will
here be made to what scientific research has made known
to us in regard to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<p>Pure glutin or gelatin is obtained by treating buckshorn,
etc., with water containing hydrochloric acid, until the
phosphate of lime which serves, so to say, as a frame for the
glue-yielding substance, is dissolved, and the organic tissue
called <em>collagen</em> or <em>ossein</em>, remains behind. After freeing the
latter from fat by steeping in milk of lime and careful washing,
it is boiled, and the resulting jelly, when cold, mechanically
distributed in cold water, in which it softens but does
not dissolve. By thoroughly stirring the mass the glutin
yields its coloring matter to the water, the latter being replaced
by fresh water until all the coloring matter is extracted.
Then pour off the water and after dissolving the
jelly in hot water, filter the solution through a cloth. By
mixing the filtered solution with an equal volume of alcohol,
a precipitate of pure glutin is obtained. By the precipitation
with alcohol, the separating glutin carries down inorganic
salts, especially phosphates, which may be present in
the solution. To free it from them, dissolve it in a small
quantity of lukewarm water, acidulate the solution with
hydrochloric acid and bring it into a dialyser. The salts
and the acids diffuse in the water which has from time to
time to be renewed, and finally a jelly of pure glutin remains
behind; this is evaporated to dryness in shallow
vessels.</p>

<p>Pure glutin, in a dry state forms a glassy substance,
almost colorless, transparent to translucent, brittle or
slightly elastic, free from odor and taste, and remains unchanged
in the air. Its specific gravity is greater than
that of water. It is neutral, exerts no influence whatever
upon vegetable colors and is insoluble in alcohol, ether,
hydrocarbons or oils. In cold water it swells up, absorbing
as much as 40 per cent., and becomes opaque, but does not
dissolve. It dissolves in hot water and on cooling forms a
jelly even if the solution contains only 1 per cent. of glutin.
It gelatinizes at a lower temperature than chondrin.</p>

<p>An aqueous solution of glutin is precipitated by chlorine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
platinic chloride, tannin and alcohol, but not by hydrochloric
acid, acetic acid, lead acetate, alum and ferric sulphate.
Concentrated sulphuric acid decomposes glutin,
forming, besides other products of decomposition, chiefly
glycocoll and leucine.</p>

<p>When heated, glutin softens, swells and diffuses an odor
of burnt hartshorn. In the air, it takes fire with difficulty,
smokes, flames only for a few minutes, and leaves a bulky
charcoal difficult to incinerate, the ashes of which consist
principally of calcium phosphate.</p>

<p>Glutin, when in the jellied state, and treated with
alcohol, undergoes dehydration, under the influence of
which it contracts greatly. It was by this means that
Gonnor succeeded in reducing in a remarkable degree the
size of a print obtained in a very hydrated film of glutin,
and transferring it, so reduced, to stone, from which he obtained
a new impression, quite similar to the first, but more
or less diminished.</p>

<p>By taking these prints, on the contrary, with glutin very
little hydrated, and afterwards steeping them in water, a
dilatation of the plate is obtained, which enlarges the figures
with the same regularity.</p>

<p>Pure <em>chondrin</em> is prepared by boiling for from 24 to 48
hours the cartilages of the ribs, of the larynx with the exception
of those of the epiglot, or of the windpipe and the
bronchi.</p>

<p>Chondrin is precipitated from its solution by alcohol.
The precipitate is redissolved in warm water, evaporated,
and dried. It forms a semi-translucent mass of a slightly
yellow color and resembles glutin as regards fracture and
all external properties, but differs from it in being precipitated
from its aqueous solution by mineral acids, acetate of
lead, alum and ferric sulphate, and also by organic acids
such as vinegar, citric and oxalic acids, none of which precipitate
glutin.</p>

<p>As regards its chemical composition, chondrin is poorer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
in nitrogen than glutin, and contains more sulphur. Its
formula approaches more closely that of albumen, which
corresponds also with the origin of chondrin, for cartilages
may be considered as transition-links between the proteïne
and glue-yielding substances.</p>

<p>By the action of concentrated sulphuric acid upon
chondrin, leucine is only produced but no glycocoll. By
potassium hydrate chondrin is converted into glutin and
yields then, like the latter, leucine and glycocoll. By boiling
with concentrated hydrochloric acid chondrin is decomposed;
a peculiar variety of fermentable sugar, to which
the term chondroglucose has been applied, being formed.</p>

<p>It may finally be remarked that chondrin possesses less
adhesive power than glutin and its presence in glue may
be considered detrimental. To avoid its formation, the glue
manufacturer should separate as much as possible cartilages
from bones. Chondrin, however, is useful for size.</p>


<h4>4. PROPERTIES OF GLUE AND ITS BEHAVIOR TOWARDS OTHER
SUBSTANCES.</h4>

<p>The product designated by the general term glue, is
always a mixture of glutin, chondrin and other substances
not yet accurately determined. Glue is formed by evaporating
and further drying the jelly, and its properties depend
on the crude glue and glue-yielding material used for the
production of the jelly.</p>

<p>It may here be remarked that even if the quantity of
glutin contained in the different products could not be determined
by scientific means, the glue obtained from various
materials can be readily distinguished by external characteristics.
Every manufacturer knows that hides and bones
yield a distinct quality of glue as regards adhesive power,
elasticity and fracture, and that the jelly from glue-yielding
substances of older animals is more solid and gives a larger
yield than that obtained from the tissues of younger and
weaker animals. Glue from the bladders and scales of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
fishes, though consisting mainly of glutin, differs materially
from hide or bone glue.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the jelly, no matter whether consisting
of glutin or chondrin, possesses, before drying to glue,
different properties from glue solution. It has less adhesive
power and spoils more quickly. At a temperature of 68°
to 72.5° F., jelly putrefies inside of 24 hours, smells of
ammonia, and decomposes, while glue solution can be kept
much longer without suffering deterioration.</p>

<p>The jelly absorbs ozone with avidity and is decomposed
by it, this being the reason why an approaching thunderstorm
may cause great damage by destroying the coagulating
power of the glue liquors, or causing the glue to turn
on the nets, <i>i. e.</i>, to lose its consistency and become liquid
and foul.</p>

<p>The behavior of glue solution towards different salts also
deserves attention.</p>

<p>By adding potassium or sodium carbonate, neutral potassium
tartrate, Rochelle or Epsom salts to a lukewarm fluid
containing 15 to 20 per cent. of glue, the latter coagulates
by the salt withdrawing the water from it. A lukewarm
solution saturated with common salt, sal ammoniac, saltpetre,
or barium chloride does not gelatinize.</p>

<p>By adding to glue solution a large quantity of alum, the
glue is precipitated as a transparent mass.</p>

<p>Glue compounded at a high temperature with dilute
acids, does not gelatinize by itself, but will do so on adding
common salt.</p>

<p>Boiling with slaked lime deprives glue solution of its
power of gelatinizing, and, on evaporation, changes it into
a colorless gummy mass which is soluble in cold water and
in saturated solution of common salt.</p>

<p>From a glutin solution compounded with oxalic acid, the
latter can after some time be again separated by the addition
of lime, the result being a non-gelatinizing fluid which,
however, possesses great adhesive power. This is the so-called
<em>meta-gelatin</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>Glue solution also loses its property of gelatinizing by repeated
boiling and cooling (for about six days).</p>

<p>Tannin enters with the jelly, as well as with glue solution,
into characteristic combinations which are formed even
in solutions containing only 0.005 per cent. of jelly or glue.
Glue is, therefore, an excellent agent for the detection of
tannin.</p>

<p>When quite concentrated glue solution is treated with
tannin, a heavy, flocculent precipitate of a dirty-yellow,
caseous character is formed, which turns brown on exposure
to the air and, after drying, constitutes a hard brittle
mass, easily reduced to powder and soluble in hot potash
lye, but insoluble in water, ether and alcohol. This precipitate,
if not identical with, is closely allied to the combination
of tannin with skin, called leather.</p>

<p>Glue exposed to a dry heat melts, diffuses a strong disagreeable
odor of burned horn and leaves behind a charcoal
which has a powerful discoloring effect like animal charcoal.
When subjected to destructive distillation, glue yields
an aqueous solution of ammonium carbonate and a thick
brown oil consisting of a mixture of ammonium carbonate,
sulphur, ammonium cyanide, etc.</p>

<p>The chemical composition of glue is such as to bring to
mind that of starch and cellulose derived from the vegetable
kingdom. It contains:</p>

<p>
Carbon              49.1 per cent.<br />
Hydrogen             6.5 per cent.<br />
Nitrogen            18.3 per cent.<br />
Oxygen and sulphur  26.1 per cent.<br />
</p>

<p>which may be represented by the formula: C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p>The composition of glue differs but little from that of the
glue-yielding substance. Isinglass is composed of:</p>

<p>
Carbon    49.5 per cent.<br />
Hydrogen   6.9 per cent.<br />
Nitrogen  18.8 per cent.<br />
Oxygen    24.8 per cent.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<p>This justifies the assumption that glue in its various
transition stages does not represent different chemical combinations,
but only modifications of one and the same combination
distinguishable from each other by physical
characteristics, as is the case with starch, which without
suffering an alteration in its composition, appears as dextrine
and grape-sugar, or as with cellulose, which, without
altering its composition, can be transformed into amyloid
and grape-sugar.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br />

<small>USES OF GLUE.</small></h3>


<p>An inquiry into the various technical uses of glue must
be of interest to the manufacturer so as to enable him,
when acting, as is frequently the case, as salesman, to know
to whom to offer his product; and also to learn what special
demands he has to satisfy, as not every glue is adapted to
every purpose, different qualities being required for special
uses.</p>

<p><i>Glue as a joining medium.</i> In Chapter I, treating of the
nature of glue, special attention has been drawn to the fact,
that the adhesive power of glutin is greater than that of
chondrin; and that glutin obtained from skin and tendons
possesses still greater adhesive power than the product from
bones. This is the reason why good sound glue made from
scraps of skin is preferred by those artisans who may be
considered the principal consumers, such as cabinet-makers,
carpenters, turners, instrument-makers, wood-carvers, carriage-builders,
brush-manufacturers, bookbinders, paper-manufacturers,
etc., all of them requiring glue of the greatest
possible adhesive power. It must, however, by no
means be understood that a good quality of bone glue cannot
be used for the same purposes; because much bone
glue of excellent quality and at a low price is brought into
the market by manufacturers of animal charcoal and bone
meal, and is used in glueing wood, etc.</p>

<p>Glue suitable as a joining medium for the above purposes
should be of an amber or brown-yellow color, transparent
or translucent, clear, dry and hard, and show a glassy fracture
which should not be brittle, but somewhat elastic.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Placed in cold water it should swell up and absorb as much
of it as possible without actually dissolving, even if it remains
there for 48 hours. The supernatant water should
be free from a putrid odor and contain but a small quantity
of foreign substances in solution. Such glue passes into
solution at 122° F., and dissolves entirely on heating to
144.5° F. Heating to a higher temperature should be
avoided.</p>

<p><i>Glue as a binding agent.</i> Glue solution is used for bind-together
pulverulent substances, such as mineral colors in
the manufacture of colored paper and paper-hangings, in
painting in distemper, in the size of the gilder; or it is
mixed with plaster of Paris or chalk for the manufacture of
plastic masses which become hard on drying, such as
stucco-work, papier-maché, etc. Generally speaking, it is
best to use only good sound glue for these purposes, though
it may sometimes be possible to utilize defective and cheap
qualities without injurious consequences. For color mixtures,
the glue should at all events be free from acids and
alkalies, as they exert a decomposing and altering effect
upon the colors. The gilder should always use the best
quality of glue, as otherwise the work he applies later on to
the size will spoil.</p>

<p>A very large quantity of glue is consumed <i>in the manufacture
of matches</i>, and much depends on its quality and
drying properties. The dipping composition for matches
containing phosphorus is a bath of glue of 25 to 50 per
cent. strength to which the requisite amount of an oxidizing
agent, like potassium nitrate or chlorate has been added,
kept at a temperature of 100.4° F. The phosphorus is
cautiously put in; it melts, and is stirred to an emulsion,
when the sand, glass or other friction-agent is incorporated.
The object of the glue is to protect from oxidation,
without diminishing the sensitiveness. Glue is also used
as the binding material in the heads and rubbers of safety
matches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p><i>Book binders</i> require for the better classes of work a glue
which should naturally be pale and strong, and without
marked odor. Some inferior glues which have been
chemically bleached turn almost black in the pot, owing to
the bleaching agent not having been properly removed or
neutralized.</p>

<p>Sand, glass and emery papers and cloths are made by
coating the surface with a thin uniform layer of strong
glue, and sifting the powder evenly on.</p>

<p><i>Glue in sizing.</i> The principal object of sizing goods is to
impart to them a certain degree of stiffness, to give them a
nice appearance and a good feel.</p>

<p>As glue would injure the color of white goods, it cannot
be used for sizing them, but, on the other hand, much is
employed for preparing size for the use of hat and cloth
manufacturers, weavers, etc. Before the introduction of
the paper machine and invention of rosin glue, animal glue
was exclusively used for sizing paper, but at the present it
is only used for sizing paper manufactured from rags, and
for pasteboard, and also by manufacturers producing drawing
paper sized with animal substances. The paper, after
leaving the machine, is passed through a glue solution and
then dried in the air.</p>

<p>For actual sizing purposes good and fine varieties of glue
are only used, or sometimes the manufacturers prepare their
own size by boiling to glue dried calves’ heads, or rabbit
skins deprived of their fur, scraps of parchment, etc. For
cheap woollen hats, glue is used in place of shellac. The
cloth manufacturer procures his glue mostly in the form of
a jelly. This variety of glue deserves special attention and
the mode of preparing it will be referred to later on.</p>

<p><i>Glue for culinary and medicinal purposes.</i> The use of
glue for these purposes is based upon three properties:</p>

<p>1: Upon its power of coagulating and inclosing while in
this state, substances mechanically dissolved and finely
divided in a fluid, which, being specifically as heavy as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
fluid itself, render the latter turbid and cannot be got rid
off by settling. The glue in this case acts as a clarifier.</p>

<p>Large quantities of isinglass and gelatine, specially prepared
for the purpose, are used for clarifying and fining
beer, wine and other liquids, as well as for preparing
jellies. The material to be used for jellies and other culinary
purposes must, of course, be colorless and entirely free
from odor. Jellies are made palatable by flavoring with
spices, sugar, essences, etc., before congealing, A vegetable
gelatine, Agar-Agar, which will be referred to later on is
now brought from China, and being cheaper and perfectly
free from odor, has become quite a competitor with isinglass
and gelatine.</p>

<p>Prior to the introduction of Liebig’s and other beef extracts,
bouillon tablets, consisting of a mixture of bone-jelly,
meat broth, extract of pot herbs and flour, were
largely used. One hundred and ten pounds of meat
repeatedly boiled yield five pounds of bouillon tablets. A
good meat broth, though not equal to that from Liebig’s or
other meat extracts, is obtained from these tablets by the
addition of thirty times their weight of water.</p>

<p>If glue be dissolved in water, it gelatinizes at the ordinary
temperature, and if the solution be mixed with other
fluids, for instance, meat broth, fruit juices and essences,
which in the form of jelly are to serve as food, it effects
their solidification.</p>

<p>Glue acts as a healing agent by preventing the access of
air to wounds. Court plaster is prepared from gelatine.
When cabinet-makers cut themselves, they apply glue to
the wound with the best success. In hospitals a compound
of gelatine and glycerine is used as the best means
of closing wounds, the same compound having also been
successfully used for preserving articles of food such as
eggs, fruit, and even meat.</p>

<p>Every good quality of glue can be used for the above
purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>Medicines of a disagreeable taste are frequently inclosed
in gelatine capsules, so that they can be taken without
causing inconvenience to the patient. The use of these
capsules has grown to such an extent as to form a special
branch of industry. The mode of manufacturing them
will be described later on.</p>

<p><i>Glue for elastic masses and as a partial substitute for rubber.</i>
Glue mixed with glycerine forms an elastic mass resembling
rubber. The same effect can be produced by an
addition of molasses. This elastic mass, the preparation of
which will be described later on, is of great importance for
the manufacture of printers’ rollers, for moulds, etc. Some
manufacturers prepare the mass ready for use, so that the
printer or lithographer need only remelt it, and cast it in a
mould.</p>

<p>Glue is of great importance in photolithography as, mixed
with chromium salts, it is the only known means of transferring
a photographic negative to the stone. In photography,
gelatine is used for negative pictures upon glass.
For the manufacturer of casts of plaster of Paris or cement,
this glue mass, which is generally used without an addition
of glycerine, is indispensable for making moulds which are
much undercut.</p>

<p>Glue mixed with glycerine may be used as a substitute
for rubber in manufacturing elastic toys, such as dolls’
heads, animals, etc. For these purposes it is advisable to
select glue which forms a very solid jelly, even if it possesses
but little adhesive power, pure bone-glue being the
best.</p>

<p>Glue mixed with glycerine (1 part glue, 1 part glycerine)
is used as hectograph mass for the transfer of matter written
with concentrated solution of aniline color.</p>

<p><i>Glue for fancy articles.</i> Great progress has been made in
the use of glue and gelatine in the manufacture of fancy
articles.</p>

<p>The best known of all these products are perhaps the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
gelatine foils. They form thin, transparent sheets, brilliantly
colored, and are used for printing sacred images,
visiting cards, labels, etc.</p>

<p>Gelatine veneers were first shown at one of the Paris International
Exhibitions. They consist of sheets varying in
thickness, which have been deprived of their translucency
by an admixture of colors in imitation of various crystallization
of salts, and such stones as lazulite, malachite and
avanturine. Glue imitations of mother of pearl, tortoise
shell, and ivory were shown which closely resembled the
genuine articles. These veneers have been largely introduced
in the manufacture of fancy articles, cabinet ware,
buttons, etc. The most brilliant use to which they have
been put is in the manufacture of fans, for which ivory and
tortoise shell were formerly used, and there are perhaps few
ladies that are aware that these glittering toys are manufactured
from horse bones from the knacker’s yard.</p>

<p>The successful introduction of gelatine veneers was soon
followed by a substitute for horn in general, and combs,
buttons, snuff-boxes, and hundreds of other fancy articles
have been manufactured from these imitations.</p>

<p>In the foregoing statement only some of the principal
uses of glue have been enumerated, and there can be no
doubt that with an increase in the knowledge of its nature
and properties, a wide field is still open for progress in this
industry.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />

<small>RAW MATERIALS AND THEIR PREPARATION FOR THE
MANUFACTURE OF GLUE.</small></h3>


<p>The raw materials used for the manufacture of glue consist
of a variety of animal offal. The principal substances
employed are refuse from tanyards, such as scraps of ox
and other thick hides, the waste of the workshops of leather
dressers, morocco leather manufacturers, etc. The tendons
and intestines of many animals, rabbit and hare skins deprived
of their fur, cat and dog skins, scraps of parchment,
waste of turners and button makers, and offal from butcher
shops and households, help to swell the series of materials
used for the manufacture of glue.</p>

<p>The materials are collected and sold either directly to the
glue boiler, or to dealers making a specialty of glue stock.</p>

<p>As a thorough knowledge of these waste products is of
importance to the manufacturer, this chapter will be devoted
to their detailed description, the success of the enterprise
depending largely on the selection of the raw materials and
their careful sorting and preparation. By bearing in mind
the varied products—from the most ordinary black glue to
the colorless glassy gelatine for photographic and culinary
purposes—it will be understood that entirely different raw
materials have to be employed for the finer products than
for the ordinary qualities of glue.</p>

<p>According to their derivation the raw materials may be
divided into three groups, namely:</p>

<p>1. Skin-like raw materials: Skin, leather, tissues.</p>

<p>2. Bone raw materials.</p>

<p>3. Materials obtained from fishes: Air bladders, scales, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>


<h4>1. ANIMAL SKIN.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p017.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This consists of three layers, namely: 1. The thin upper-skin—the
epidermis—which consists only of cellular tissue,
and is of no special importance for the manufacture of glue.
2. The actual leather-skin, or corium, which consists of
fibres of connective tissue and forms the actual object of the
tanner as well as of the glue boiler. Underneath the
corium lies the under-skin, which consists only of cellular
tissue contaminated with particles of flesh and fat, which
are detrimental to the manufacture of glue. Fig. 1 represents
a section of the animal skin. <i>O</i>, is the epidermis, <i>L</i>,
the corium, <i>U</i>, the under-skin. The epidermis consists of
two layers. The first, superficial one, <i>H</i>, is known as the
cuticle or lamellar layer, and the other deeper layer, <i>S</i>, as the
mucous or malpighian layer. The corium also consists of
two layers, the upper one <i>C</i>, and the lower one <i>C<sub>1</sub></i>, which is
the actual leather-skin. The under-skin, <i>U</i>, is an elastic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
tissue containing many deposits of fat, <i>F</i>, and perspiratory
glands, <i>D</i>, which are connected with ducts, <i>D<sub>1</sub></i>, with the
surface of the skin.</p>

<p>For the manufacturer of leather and glue, the corium is
the only material of value.</p>

<p>The tanner trims the skins before steeping them in the
ooze. From sheep and calf skins he removes the head portions,
it being more advantageous to use them for glue
stock. He also cuts off the skin covering the lower part of
the thighs, and, to give the skin a neat finish, the ragged
edges of the belly part. Of bullock hides, the ears, tails
and foot pieces are utilized for glue stock, while the head
parts are tanned. Such tannery waste may yield 44 to 46
per cent. of glue. Scarf skin of bullocks’ hides and waste
in fleshing the hide, tendons and hinder parts of cattle
yield from 30 to 35 per cent.; horse sinews from 15 to 18
per cent.</p>

<p>Scraps of parchment and bullocks’ feet are highly valued
as glue stock, since they are in fit condition for boiling
without further preparation. They may yield up to 62 per
cent. of their weight in glue.</p>

<p>Calf and sheep skins yield a superior glue; that from
horse hides is usually dark and poor in quality, although
with careful working a strong product can be obtained from
the latter.</p>

<p>Of great value to the glue boiler are the so-called calves’
heads, which, after liming and drying, form a special article
of commerce.</p>

<p>Skins of hogs, hares and rabbits yield a light-colored glue
of little consistency. It is, therefore, best to use these last-named
raw materials for the preparation of jelly, such as is
used in sizing, in the manufacture of paper, etc.</p>

<p>The older the animals from which the skins have been
derived, the more solid the glue will be. In many cases,
especially where a certain quality of glue is to be produced,
it may be recommended to separate the different kinds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
skin refuse into lots, provided there is enough of each kind
to boil it separately.</p>

<p>A considerable number of skins used for packing various
articles, such as indigo from South Africa, have been so
much damaged in transit as to render them useless for tanning,
but they form good material for glue, frequently
yielding 50 to 55 per cent.</p>

<p>In reference to judging glue stock some valuable notes
are given in an article on glue, published by the American
Provision Co., Chicago, Ills.:</p>

<p>“Dry, uncured or salted stock, such as raw hide or South
American, if soaked for twelve hours in cold water, gains
about 50 per cent. in weight, and still remains tough, and
the water sweet. The moisture, dirt, and salt should not
be over 10 per cent.</p>

<p>“Green salted stock, such as hide pieces, sinews, calf
heads and pates, should have no excess of salt, nor be foul,
discolored or heated; should be tough, with the hair not
loose, and have a mild animal odor. Moisture and salt not
over 40 per cent.</p>

<p>“Dry limed stock soaked twelve hours develops a characteristic
odor, and should be firm, fibrous, and have no
slimy pieces. The water should not be dark. Lime, sand
and dirt, not over 5 per cent.</p>

<p>“Green limed stock should be smooth and soft, any remaining
hair being easily detachable, while the liquor
should be fairly clean, sweet, and not too alkaline.</p>

<p>“A large quantity of waste bones accumulates in the
preparation of tinned provisions. If these have not been
overheated and are in good condition, a considerable
amount of glue can be obtained from them, the bones of
the head, ribs, and feet giving a better yield than those of
the thighs and legs.</p>

<p>“Horn piths should not contain over 12 per cent. moisture,
and should not have been overheated in drying; they
should have been cleansed from skin and hair, which are
of little value to the glue-maker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>“The age of the animals yielding glue stock has an important
influence on the product. While from younger
animals the product, as a rule, is of lighter color, more
abundant and more easily obtained, it contains more
chondrin, so that from solutions of equal strengths, those
from mature animals will be found to be of greater consistence
and the glue more solid.</p>

<p>“Abroad, dry hides are often, for weighing, soaked in
chlorbarium, a solution of barium chloride, and then in a
bath of dilute sulphuric acid, 1½ per cent., which readily
soaks in, combines with the barium to form the white insoluble
powder of barium sulphate, leaving weak hydrochloric
acid in the fibre, to be afterwards neutralized in
liming, the chloride of calcium dissolving out. This treatment
affects considerably the subsequent making of glue,
as, beside the effects of the acids, the sulphate of barium
will render the liquors cloudy and difficult to clarify. Of
course if colored glues are to be made this will be no detriment.”</p>

<p>To prevent putrefaction, which is always accompanied by
decomposition of glue-yielding substance and consequent
loss, the scraps must be carefully preserved, especially in
summer.</p>

<p>The tanner prepares the waste by liming, <i>i. e.</i>, steeping it
during fifteen to twenty days in milk of lime which is
frequently renewed. By the action of the lime, adhering
particles of blood and flesh are dissolved and the fatty
matter is saponified. After this treatment the glue-stock
is dried.</p>

<p>In case this work is not done carefully in the tanyard, as
is only too frequently the case, the stock is of but little
value to the glue-boiler.</p>

<p>By allowing the refuse to lie too long in a heap, as is
sometimes done, putrid fermentation sets in, the injurious
effects of which cannot be remedied by subsequent liming,
or the lime bath has not yet been strong enough, or has not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
acted sufficiently long upon the scraps to destroy the adhering
particles of blood and flesh. The lime bath, on the
other hand, may have been too strong, so as to attack the
glue-yielding substance. Frequently it is also the case that
the scraps having been dried under unfavorable circumstances,
mould has commenced to form, and finally they
may be spoiled in winter by allowing them to freeze.
Frozen glue leather yields glue of very little consistency.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the foregoing that great precaution
and care are required when buying glue leather. The
manufacturer should especially see that it is dry and tough,
free from mould and all organic and inorganic substances,
and not too strongly limed.</p>

<p>The glue-boiler should, in all cases, be prepared to undertake
the preparation of the glue stock himself. The following
arrangements are required for the purpose:</p>

<p>Let us assume that the glue factory is located on a stream
of water. In the immediate neighborhood of the stream a
sufficient number of pits to prepare all the glue stock used,
each about 6½ feet deep and 6½ to 10 feet in diameter, and
lined with cement, are so arranged that their bottoms are
about 3 to 3½ feet above the level of the water. They are
supplied with water by means of a pipe line connecting one
with the other. Each pit is provided with a discharge pipe
to draw off the dirty water.</p>

<p>As the glue-stock, before undergoing other operations,
has to be freed from the lime by washing with water, the
simplest plan is to place the limed stock in nets or wicker
baskets suspended in running water by means of a traveling
crane or other contrivance erected on the bank of the
stream. This elementary method, however, is open to several
disadvantages, as it fouls a large volume of water and
may lead to legal interference, and its very simplicity is apt
to lead to neglect of precautions, such as brushing away
solid particles of lime or softened animal matters. Further,
the great quantities of water carry off small pieces of glue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>-stock
and fat, if catch-basins are not provided sufficiently
large to allow fat, glue-stock, hair and lime to separate
from the water.</p>

<p>The object is better accomplished and in a shorter time
by the use of a washing drum. This consists of a perforated
iron cylinder about 6 feet in diameter and 4 feet in length,
and open on both ends. Around the inside of the cylinder
are fixed a number of wooden shelves 6 inches broad,
which, as the cylinder revolves, carry the glue-stock partly
round, ultimately falling to the bottom again, the movement
dashing it about under a spray of water. In the
cylinder is also arranged an iron plate supported by stays
from the outside. While the washing is in operation the
plate is turned perpendicular; on completion it is brought
to a horizontal position, forming a table, on which the glue-stock
falls, and the latter is then removed to a hand-press
to squeeze out the water. The washed stock is then removed
to the drying ground, which should be in a sunny
and airy location, and provided with an inclined floor of
planks or cement so arranged as to allow of the admittance
of air from beneath.</p>

<p>As it is well known that small quantities of liquid, frequently
renewed and thoroughly drained off each time,
effect the most complete and economical washing, and in
the shortest time, S. Rideal recommends the use of pits or
vats with proper arrangements for stirring, draining and
inspection. The lime scum from the pits can be used in
the manufacture of fertilizers.</p>

<p>The glue-stock washer shown in Figs. 2 to 5, is the invention
of W. A. Hoeveler (American patent), and it relates
to the construction of apparatus for washing glue-stock.</p>

<p>In apparatus for this purpose the stock is very commonly
damaged by being broken up too much, and considerable
loss results, besides, from the fact that the small particles
are allowed to escape with the wash-water. By the present
construction and arrangement these defects are remedied
and other advantages derived.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p023-4.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The apparatus is constructed in the form of a rectangular
trough-like structure, with its sides and ends, <i>A</i>, substantially
water-tight by means of the double walls, <i>a a</i>. The
upper portion of the interior is occupied by the swinging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
wash-box, <i>B</i>, semicircular in shape, with flat sides and
rounded bottom throughout, the bottom being perforated.</p>

<p>Upon a transverse shaft, <i>c</i>, journaled at the axis of box,
<i>B</i>, is set a paddle-wheel composed of a suitable hub, <i>d</i>, and
adjustable paddles, each composed of the radial stem, <i>e</i>, and
the blade, <i>f</i>, or spoon. The spoons, <i>f</i> are set on the stems,
<i>e</i>, so as to be capable of being reversed or turned half-way
round, more or less. One side of the spoon, <i>f</i>, is rounded
off, so that while passing through the stock the latter will
not cling to or remain upon it. The other side of the spoon
is flat, but slightly skewed or bevelled, so that when turned
to face with the direction of motion of the wheel it not only
gathers up the stock and holds it till out of the box, <i>B</i>, but
upon further elevation causes it to roll or slide along the
paddle to a predetermined point, where it falls off gently
into a discharge-spout, <i>g</i>, which carries it off for further
treatment practically undamaged. During the operation
the box, <i>B</i>, and the body, <i>A</i>, are kept supplied by a stream
of clean or chemically-prepared water, and the wheel, <i>e f</i>,
revolves slowly in the box, the edges of the paddles sweeping
around, while the box, <i>B</i>, or its bottom, is kept oscillating,
thus preventing an injurious clogging of the perforations
in the box-bottom. After the stock is placed in the
box, <i>B</i>, and the latter filled with sufficient water, the wheel,
<i>e f</i>, is caused to slowly revolve (by motive or hand power),
with the rounded sides of the spoons, <i>f</i>, presented forward.
This operation thoroughly agitates and cleanses the stock,
while the rounded form of the spoons prevents the breaking
up of the natural condition of the stock. The inventor
gathers the finer particles as follows, after they have escaped
through the perforated bottom of the wash-box, <i>B</i>. At the
lower part of the trough, <i>A</i>, elevated on crossbars or blocks,
<i>h</i>, he places two parallel strips, <i>i</i>, and between these, which
are grooved to form ways, <i>k</i>, inside, is set a long screen, <i>l</i>,
placed on rollers, <i>m</i>, and movable thereby on the rails or
ways, <i>k</i>. To give movement to the screen, <i>l</i>, the inventor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
attaches to its end a rod, <i>n</i>, which projects outwardly
through the walls, <i>a a</i>, by means of the packing-box, <i>p</i>, and
cap or door, <i>q</i>, which, when opened, allows the withdrawal
of the screen, <i>l</i>, and its burden. The shaking of the screen
is accomplished by a suitable motor applied to rod, <i>n</i>, and
is kept going during the operation as required. To the
strips, <i>i</i>, which are placed at a little distance from the side
walls, <i>a</i> (to leave a passage for the water and refuse to go
through), are hinged the two doors, <i>r</i>, which shut down
upon the rod, <i>s</i>, as a support, in which case nothing can
fall upon the screen, or which open up and rest against the
sides, <i>a a</i>, in which case the screen is exposed and the side
passages closed by the doors, <i>r</i>. During the initial or
rough-washing stage the doors, <i>r</i>, are kept closed, and the
dirty water and refuse pass freely down the side passages
and out at a suitable opening at the bottom. After this
stage it becomes desirable to catch the particles which get
detached from the stock in box, <i>B</i>, and come through the
perforations therein. Then open up the doors, <i>r</i>, thus closing
the side passages and compelling all the water and
small stock to go to the screen, <i>l</i>, which catches the remaining
stock. When sufficiently accumulated the screen may
be drawn out and the stock thereon removed. When the
main body of stock in box, <i>B</i>, has been cleansed, the paddles
or spoons, <i>f</i>, are reversed, so as to present their flat,
skewed faces to the stock, and in revolving the paddles now
gently lift the stock and discharge it into the spout or hopper,
<i>g</i>. The washing and removal of the stock when washed
are thus accomplished without further manipulation than
to reverse the paddles, which obviously could be done by a
reversing-gear on the motor, thereby reversing the direction
of movement of the paddle-wheel.</p>

<p>Instead of the whole box <i>B</i> being oscillated back and
forth, its bottom may be set on slides or rollers and oscillated,
while the sides remain stationary.</p>

<p>In the drawings the box <i>B</i> is shown as hung upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
shaft <i>c</i> as a centre; but as the provision of means of reciprocating
or oscillating the box or its bottom is within the
skill of any machinist, it is not necessary to describe any
specific form. As the box with its contents will be very
heavy, the inventor prefers a special motor for it, which may
also be geared up to reciprocate the screen <i>l</i>.</p>

<p>Instead of the door <i>q</i>, as located in Fig. 2, it can be
located as at <i>q’</i>, same figure.</p>

<p>The entire plant must of course be arranged according
to sanitary regulations, especially as regards river pollution,
etc.</p>

<p>The sheds for sorting and storing the glue-stock should,
if possible, be in close proximity to the pits and washing
drums, and be dry and airy. In arranging his plant, the
glue manufacturer must, in short, exercise his ingenuity
with a view to carrying on the business with as little loss of
material, and as much saving of time and labor as possible.</p>

<p>The work in a factory arranged in the above manner, is
carried on as follows:</p>

<p>The raw materials brought by the dealer are weighed,
and if in green state, the customary percentage—generally
50 per cent.—taken off. To facilitate future operations,
and to enable the manufacturer to produce different varieties
of glue, the dry materials are sorted and stored in different
compartments of the store-shed.</p>

<p>Green waste, <i>i. e.</i>, such as has not been limed must be
taken in hand at once, as otherwise it would taint the air,
be attacked by rats and other animals, and suffer injurious
alterations by decomposition. The manner of operation is
as follows:</p>

<p><i>Liming.</i> Prepare “milk of lime” by filling the pits,
which are to serve for the reception of the skin waste, with
the required quantity of water and dissolve in it 2 per cent.
of calcium hydrate obtained by slaking a good quality of
quick lime. Stir thoroughly, and in order that the water
may become thoroughly saturated with the lime, let the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
liquor stand for 8 or 10 days before placing the waste in it.
The liquor should stand about 9 inches deep over the waste
in the pits. The length of time the waste has to remain in
the milk of lime varies according to the material; calf skins
requiring 15 to 20 days, sheep skins 20 to 30 days, and
heavy ox hides 30 to 40 days. The milk of lime should be
renewed once or twice a week, and thoroughly stirred.</p>

<p>For the purpose of liming, the quality of the lime used
is of the utmost importance, the milk of lime being
frequently quite valueless by reason of having become carbonated
or a bad quality of quick lime having been originally
employed. It should be borne in mind that only the
hydrate of lime which is present in solution in lime water
is of use, whereas in milk of lime so much carbonate and
other impurities may be present that the liquid, though
thick, may be quite useless. The value of a lime should
always be tested by determining the amount of real calcium
hydroxide, Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, contained in it. The operation according
to S. Rideal, is conducted as follows: Water free from
carbonic acid is first prepared by boiling distilled water for
half an hour in a strong, round-bottomed Bohemian or Jena
flask. While steam is still issuing, the flask is removed for
an instant, closed by a well-fitting greased cork or a rubber
stopper, and allowed to cool. When the temperature has
somewhat fallen, the cooling may be cautiously accelerated
by dipping into a pail of warm water, then transferring to
the cold stream from a tap. The water may be preserved
in the flask or, preferably, a number of bottles with vase-lined
stoppers should be filled quite full and retained for
use.</p>

<p>From the sample of lime, well mixed, a small portion
(about 0.25 gramme) should be accurately and rapidly
weighed, placed in a wide-mouthed, stoppered bottle holding
about 300 cubic centimeters, 250 Cc. of the boiled
water added, and then allowed to settle. The whole of the
calcium hydrate will now have dissolved. Fifty cubic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
centimeters of the clear liquid should now be withdrawn
by a pipette, transferred to a flask, colored with an indicator—either
phenol-phthalein, methyl-orange, or litmus
may be used—and its alkalinity determined by running in
decinormal hydrochloric or sulphuric acid from a burette
till the change of color occurs. Each cubic centimeter of
the acid corresponds to 0.0028 gramme of calcium oxide,
or 0.0037 gramme of the hydrate, Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>. The amount
by calculation will give the percentage of real lime present
in the sample. It is well to notice that any soda or potash
present will equally neutralize the acid, and be returned as
lime, but as these are of almost equal efficiency their
presence in <em>small quantity</em> has no disadvantage. For
special work it will be necessary to have a full analysis.
As a rule the product made from limestone, or “stone
lime,” is the best article in commerce, and is much more
free from stones and clay than “gray lime” or “shell
lime.” The best stone lime contains sometimes only ½ per
cent. of impurities, and seldom more than 5 per cent., while
inferior kinds of gray lime may contain as much as 50 per
cent., and would be of little use in glue-making.</p>

<p>After removal from the lime pit, the material is placed
in willow baskets or nets, and immersed in the stream to
remove the greater portion of the lime, which is generally
effected in a few days. It is still more effectively accomplished
by placing the waste, after soaking in the willow
baskets, in the wash drums. After taking it from the
baskets or wash drums it is spread in the drying yard to
drain and dry, the desiccation being accelerated by turning
it over with a fork several times a day. While drying, the
quick-lime is converted into carbonate, the latter exerting
no disturbing effect in the manufacture of glue. When
sufficiently dried, the material is ready for boiling, and the
crude glue thus obtained can be stored for any length of
time, until wanted for further manipulation.</p>

<p>In summer it is scarcely possible to cleanse the raw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
material as rapidly as it is brought to the factory, and to
work it immediately without putrefaction setting in, and
for this reason it would frequently be risky to purchase
larger quantities of it, even if offered at very favorable
terms. During the colder season of the year, drying of the
cleansed raw material is such a slow operation, that in
order to prevent putrefaction, recourse would have to be
had to artificial heat.</p>

<p>These drawbacks can, however, be overcome by the use
of carbolic acid, which possesses in a high degree the property
of preventing putrefaction. It is quite cheap, and as
but a comparatively small quantity of it is required, the
additional cost need scarcely be taken into consideration,
since the value of glue-stock annually destroyed by putrefaction
is considerably greater than the expense for carbolic
acid.</p>

<p>The raw material is thoroughly cleansed, and while in a
moist state is gradually brought into a brick cistern or
large vat, carbolic acid solution being poured over each
layer, so that, when the cistern or vat is filled, it stands
about an inch or two deep over the material. The latter
may be left in this state until wanted.</p>

<p>The carbolic acid solution is prepared by dissolving 2 lbs.
of carbolic acid in 1000 quarts of water; the fluid thus obtained
possessing a slight odor of smoke. The washed glue-stock
treated as above described with carbolic acid remains
absolutely unchanged, and when wanted needs only be
taken from the cistern and worked like fresh material.</p>

<p>In plants having no running water at their disposal and
depending entirely on well water, and where the waste
water has to be discharged into rivers or creeks, water containing
carbolic acid should be used for all the washing
operations, a fluid containing 1 to 2 parts of carbolic acid
in 10,000 parts of water being sufficient for this purpose.
Such an addition of carbolic acid prevents the wash-water
from becoming foul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<p>Carbolic acid has the tendency of hardening the glue-stock
and imparting its odor to the glue, and among other
antiseptics, formaldehyde and boric acid have been recommended
for the purpose of preventing putrefaction for a
reasonable time. Formaldehyde in weak solution (1 part
in 10,000 to 100,000 parts water) has been found beneficial.
In this small quantity it does not harden the stock nor
affect the subsequent boiling, as it is dissipated by the heat.
Boric acid and its preparations, notwithstanding their low
antiseptic power, are much in favor. A fluid containing 1
part boric acid in 200 parts water will have to be used.</p>

<p>The principal varieties of hides and leather for glue-stock
may be classed as follows:</p>

<p>1. Bullock leather from old animals, highly limed,
mixed with rump pieces, also with horse leather, the latter
being thin, of a dark color and soft, and is of less value
than bullock leather, because it yields a dark glue. Fat
leather is bullock’s leather from fat, stall-fed cattle, and before
use has to be freed from fat (by means of benzine).</p>

<p>2. Pieces of hide from the lower parts of the limbs of
cattle, not limed and with the hair; they form excellent
glue-stock, yielding a very adhesive glue.</p>

<p>3. Worn-out hinges from weavers’ looms, consisting of
strongest untanned bullock’s hide. When treated with
lime they yield a very strong glue, but are worked with
difficulty.</p>

<p>4. Whip leather. This is waste in the manufacture of
whips, and is derived from thick tawed bullock hide. It
yields an excellent, light-colored glue.</p>

<p>5. Calf leather. Broad, thin, translucent strips, slightly
limed, yields glue of a very light color.</p>

<p>6. Calves’ heads. The skin of calves’ heads, limed, without
hair. They constitute the best material for gelatine,
and form a special article of commerce.</p>

<p>7. Calves’ feet. The skin from the last but one leg-joint
which is cut off from dry, unlimed, haired skins. It is the
best material next to calves’ heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>8. Knapsack leather. Old knapsacks of calf skin and
waste in the manufacture of new ones, tawed with the hair
on with alum and common salt. When suitably washed
this yields good glue-stock. The alum and common salt
have to be completely removed by washing. The hair is
no detriment to the process of boiling, it serving as a filter
for the glue running off. To this class belong also all
kinds of fur waste, especially remnants of old fur coats
(sheep skin coats), from which the wool is removed and the
skin used as glue-stock. All these materials having been
treated with alum and common salt have to be freed from
them by suitable manipulation.</p>

<p>9. Hare and rabbit skins freed from their fur. They
yield a light-colored glue of little consistency.</p>

<p>10. Cut rabbit skins. In depriving these skins of their
fur, they are cut by a machine into fine threads of even
size. In France they are worked into size for gilders’ use
which is highly valued.</p>

<p>11. Sheep and lamb leather (goat leather) limed, thin
and very light, yields but a small quantity of glue of little
consistency. To this class belongs the waste in the manufacture
of kid gloves. Waste of morocco and other varieties
of similar leather, pressed into bales and secured with wire,
comes into commerce under the name of Levant leather.</p>

<p>12. Waste obtained in paring kid leather and in the
manufacture of gloves. It constitutes a flocculent powder
and yields very thin glue liquor with slight adhesive power.
Before boiling, the substances used in tanning must be completely
removed by washing.</p>

<p>13. Surrons. These are untanned, unlimed skins of various
wild animals (antelopes, gazelles) which have been
used for packing leaf tobacco and various drugs. They
form good glue stock.</p>


<h4>2. BONES AND CARTILAGES.</h4>

<p>In addition to hides, bones are a material highly valued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
by the glue boiler. Chemically speaking, the framework
supporting the fleshy tissues of the animal order, and which
we call bones, is a combination of phosphates of lime and
magnesia, carbonate of lime, and alkaline salts, united with
fatty and cartilaginous matter. To the latter we look for
our yield of glue; to the fatty matter for the fat, and to the
phosphates for the basis of fertilizers.</p>

<p>Bone cartilage is composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen
and nitrogen, the percentage composition being practically
constant, whether the cartilage be from an old or a young
animal. The bones of the young are, however, much
richer in cartilage than those of the old. This is reversed
in the case of the inorganic or mineral matter, the old having
the greatest yield of phosphates.</p>

<p>Then again, the fatty matters are more in evidence in
full-grown animals than in youth or age; also in the thigh
and leg bones the yield is higher than in the heads, ribs or
shoulder blades, the latter averaging 12 to 13 per cent.,
whilst the former runs 18 to 19 per cent.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Bone Products and Manures. By Thomas Lambert. London, 1901.</p></div>

<p>Bones being less subject to putrefaction than skin-stock,
they are not brought into commerce in a prepared state.
They are mainly bought by contract from various dealers
within easy access to the works. The rates are generally
fixed for a certain period, and cover all classes of common
bones, whether fresh butchers’ or a mixture with partly
boiled bones. Bones differ considerably in their value. A
fresh bone will yield the highest percentage of fat and glue.
On the other hand, partly boiled bones may contain only 6
per cent. fat with 30 per cent. water. In buying bones the
manufacturer should exercise great care, as the dealer
sometimes finds ways and means of including hoofs, horns,
iron, beefy matter, and even pieces of brick. Naturally
they form weight, but, excepting the horns, have no value.</p>

<p>To separate the different classes of bone coming into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
works, and arrange them according to the amounts they
would produce of fat and glue, is no doubt a desirable
object, but in practice it is seldom carried out. However,
if the manufacturer wishes to undertake this tedious work,
it is recommended to make the following distinctions:</p>

<p>1. Bones of young animals, sheep, calves, dogs, cats, etc.,
being readily disintegrated, are thrown into one pile, and
also the light bones of oxen, such as skull bones, shoulder
bones, the vertebra of the tail, etc.</p>

<p>2. A second pile is made of the foot bones of goats, sheep
and cattle, provided they can be had, as is the case in the
United States and England, in sufficiently large quantities.</p>

<p>3. Scraps and shavings from bucks’-horn from turners
and button-makers.</p>

<p>4. Thick bones of oxen, horses, etc., which must remain
longer in the lime-bath, together with waste of hard bones
from turners.</p>

<p>5. Where large quantities of bones are handled it is advisable
to sort out the bones of the upper thigh, as they can
be more advantageously used for the manufacture of piano-keys,
handles for tooth-brushes, etc. Hoofs, which are
frequently found, should be thrown out, as they yield no
glue and can be utilized for other purposes.</p>

<p>The further manipulation of the bones for the manufacture
of glue requires first of all their crushing or grinding
in a stamper or mill. By this crushing or grinding of the
bones two objects are attained, namely, they are more
readily deprived of their fat and present more points of
attack to the corrosive agents to be used later on. The
crushed bones are put in a large boiler, and for a few hours
subjected to the action of steam. Leg bones, as well as
horns, should not be boiled, as they contain no fat, and
would lose too much glue-yielding substance. After boiling,
the bones are placed in a lime vat for 8 to 14 days.
The water used for boiling the first portion of bones may
be used for a second one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>The extracted fat amounting to 4 or 5 per cent. of the
quantity of bones used, is taken off the surface of the cold
liquor and the latter may be utilized as a fertilizer, or fed
to cattle.</p>

<p>For crushing the bones, a stamping mill is generally used,
it yielding, when properly constructed, material for the
manufacture of glue, as well as granulated bones which
form an excellent product for the preparation of animal
charcoal.</p>

<p>Since animal charcoal in pieces of quite even size is now
in general demand, it is recommended to manipulate the
bones in the above-described manner, to sell the granules to
the manufacturer of animal charcoal, and use for boiling
glue only the completely-crushed portions and the porous
bones which are not at all suitable for the manufacture of
animal charcoal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p034.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Fig. 6 shows a stamping mill very suitable for the crushing
of bones, the illustration showing the mill open on the
left side and closed on the right. It is furnished with 16
stamps, <i>D</i>, each stamp being provided with a cast-iron shoe.
The stamps are lifted by means of a cam shaft in such a
manner, that the height of fall of the outermost pairs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
stamps is least and that of those in the centre greatest.
Between the inner stamps is a sieve <i>H</i> with meshes of sufficient
size to allow the largest pieces, which can be produced
by granulation, to fall through.</p>

<p>Underneath the sieve is an Archimedean screw <i>K</i> for
carrying off the pieces of bone passing through the sieve.</p>

<div class="center" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p035-1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p035-2.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The base of the stamping mill consists of iron plates so
arranged as to form steps, the plates lying towards the
center of the mill constituting the lowest steps. Every two
stamps standing alongside one another rest upon such a
step. When the mill is set in motion, the bones reaching
the stamping trough from the right and left fall upon the
steps, and are crushed by the descending stamps.</p>

<p>As a rule, the bones to be stamped are not brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
directly into the stamping trough, but are first passed
through a crushing mill and the coarser pieces thus obtained
are subjected to the action of the stamping mill.</p>

<p>Figs. 7 and 8 show a well-constructed bone crusher. It
consists essentially of two cast-iron rollers <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, furnished
with case-hardened cutters. The bones are introduced
through the hopper <i>B</i>, and the rolls set in motion by
means of cog-wheels <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. The bearings of the roll <i>B</i>
run in a carriage which can be shifted by the lever-construction
<i>f i</i>. The object of this contrivance is to allow of
the roll <i>B</i> giving way in case a harder material than
bones, for instance, a stone, passes between the rolls.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p036.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Crosskill bone mill, Fig. 9, as described by S. Rideal,
is intended to be driven by a strap from the fly wheel of
a common portable engine. It consists of a pair of strong
rollers made of wrought-iron with case-hardened cutters,
and a revolving or oscillating riddle for separation of the
ground bones as they fall from the cutters; the whole carried
by a substantial cast-iron frame. The mill will grind
from 6 to 16 hundred-weight per hour with a three to eight
horse-power engine.</p>

<p>For sorting the crushed bones into pieces of equal size, a
sieve, Fig. 10, is used consisting of a drum constructed of
narrow boards covered with wire-netting of different de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>grees
of fineness. The upper portion <i>A</i> of the drum consists
of narrow-meshed net and through this falls the fine
meal which is conveyed by the Archimedean screw <i>F</i> over
the frame <i>F G H</i> into vessels serving for its reception.</p>

<p>The lower section, <i>B</i>, of the drum is furnished with
netting, the meshes of which become gradually wider towards
the lower end, and, hence, the smallest particles of
bone fall through the funnel, <i>D</i>, the medium-sized ones
through <i>E</i>, and the largest ones through <i>F</i>. Pieces which
cannot pass through <i>F</i>, leave the drum at <i>G</i>.</p>

<p>In factories manufacturing glue as well as animal charcoal,
the larger pieces are steamed by themselves to obtain
their fat, and then charred, while the small pieces and the
meal are utilized for glue.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p037.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The lime-bath used for bones should be of the same
strength as that for skin-stock. After removal from the
lime vat and washing, the bones are put in a tank of stone
or wood (brick pits should not be used) containing cold
hydrochloric acid of 70° Bé. or 1.05 specific gravity (= 10.6
per cent. HCl) for thick bones, or half that strength for
thin bones, and are thus left to digest for 8 to 14 days,
being frequently stirred and fresh acid added. By the
action of the acid the calcium phosphate is dissolved and
the bones become cartilaginous, flexible and transparent.
The phosphates can be precipitated by ammonia, or the
whole evaporated with charcoal or silica, and distilled to
make phosphorus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>When sufficiently softened, the stock is washed in wicker
baskets or a washing drum to remove adhering acid. They
are then placed for one day in the lime liquor, again
washed, and then either dried or stored away for future use,
or boiled at once to glue, while in a moist state.</p>

<p>Leg bones, horns, and other soft bones which contain
scarcely any fatty matter are not steamed for the reason
previously stated, but in all other respects are treated like
steamed bones.</p>

<p>It is of the greatest importance that the bones should be
thoroughly freed from acid, since even the smallest quantity
remaining behind exerts an injurious effect upon the
finished glue. It is therefore recommended to test the
water draining off, or the bones themselves, with litmus.
If the tincture turns red, it is a sure indication of the presence
of free acid, and the washing must be continued until
the blue color of the tincture remains constant.</p>

<p>Gerland’s suggestion, to use dilute sulphurous acid in
place of hydrochloric acid for dissolving the phosphates of
the bones, and to evaporate the sulphurous acid by heating,
whereby the phosphates are precipitated in an insoluble
state, has now been quite generally introduced.</p>

<p>For the preparation of gelatine from bones, Jullion and
Pirie’s process may be recommended. It requires a somewhat
expensive plant, but saves hydrochloric acid and
time. The process consists essentially in dissolving the
phosphates of the bones in vacuum. A box of wood, or
better of granite, which can be closed air-tight, is required
for this purpose. The box is filled with bones, and acid of
the previously-mentioned strength poured over them. The
box is then closed and the air pumped out by water or
steam power. The smallest cracks and pores of the bones
are thus freed from air, and the latter is replaced by hydrochloric
acid, which in this manner acts rapidly and is completely
exhausted. The remaining crude glue is then
further worked in the usual way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>Bones honey-combed by putrefaction, exposure to the
weather, or burial in the ground are of little or no value to
the glue-boiler, as nearly all the glue-yielding substance has
been destroyed; they should therefore be thrown out in buying
stock. The ammonia which is formed when putrefaction
sets in, colors the glue dark.</p>


<h4>3. LEATHER WASTE.</h4>

<p>Leather tanned with a substance insoluble in water is not
directly suitable for manufacturing glue, but can be made
so by a special process, which, though somewhat tedious,
nevertheless pays for the trouble.</p>

<p>In using such stock the manufacturer should make a distinction
between old and new leather. The principal
materials of this kind, large quantities of which contribute
their quota to the glue-boiler’s stock, are old shoes, straps,
harness, etc., and further, waste from shoemakers, trunk-makers,
and in fact from the shops of all workers in leather
except those using alumed leather.</p>

<p>Before boiling the leather waste to glue, the removal of
all traces of tannin becomes absolutely necessary, since the
retention of the smallest quantity prevents the animal tissue
from dissolving in water.</p>

<p>The various methods proposed for the preparation of the
leather waste differ either in the chemical solvent used, or
in the mechanical manipulation of the waste.</p>

<p>The principal point in all methods is to comminute the
waste as uniformly as possible to facilitate the complete removal
of the tannin.</p>

<p>Various machines, some very complicated, have been
proposed for the comminution of the waste, but a rag engine
or “hollander” such as is used by paper-makers deserves
preference for the purpose, as it not only comminutes,
washes and prepares the waste in a suitable manner for the
manufacture of glue, but the leather pulp when mixed with
rags or woody fibre gives a substitute for leather which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
very tough and of good appearance, and can be worked into
many articles.</p>

<p>After the preparation in the hollander and careful washing
the waste is treated, according to Stenhouse, under a
pressure of two atmospheres in a boiler with water to which
is added 15 per cent. of the quantity of waste to be treated
at one time of slaked lime.</p>

<p>By another method the extraction of the tannin is effected
by boiling the leather pulp with caustic soda of 1.025 specific
gravity for from six to twelve hours. After drawing
off the water and pressing out, the pulp is again boiled with
caustic soda of the same concentration. The next process
is to carefully wash out the soda, which is best effected in
the hollander.</p>

<p>By neutralizing the soda lye in the fluid drawn off after
the first boiling, it can be re-used for tanning or purposes
for which tannin is required.</p>

<p>According to another method, the <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> is as
follows:</p>

<p>Dissolve 1½ lbs. of oxalic acid in 3 gallons of water, pour
the boiling solution over 110 lbs. of waste, and keep the
mixture in a water-bath at a temperature of 176° to 212° F.
This effects the solution of the pulp. Then dilute the solution
by adding gradually 4 gallons of water until a uniform
mass is formed. Now add 5 lbs. of lime slaked to a thin
paste, and mix the whole thoroughly. The mass becomes
friable and pulverulent. It is passed through a wire sieve
and then exposed to the air. In three to four weeks the
tannin is entirely destroyed, which is recognized by the
mass assuming a lighter color. The lime is then removed
by washing with water and hydrochloric acid. If the tannin
has not been entirely destroyed by exposure to the air,
add 1 lb. of liquid ammonia and a like quantity of pyrolusite
to every 110 lbs. of leather substance when boiling it to
glue. The oxygen yielded up by the pyrolusite, which, in
the presence of ammonia, exerts no injurious effect upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
glue, destroys the last traces of tannin. Frequent stirring
with a shovel while the material is exposed to the air and
moderate heating, facilitates the destruction of the tannin.</p>


<h4>4. RAW MATERIALS FOR FISH GLUE.</h4>

<p>The air-bladders or sounds of various fishes contain much
glue-yielding substance and on account of its purity, the
product known as isinglass obtained from them is preferably
used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The high price
of the raw material excludes it from being used by the
glue-boiler, but as he manufactures substitutes for isinglass,
and should therefore have a thorough knowledge of the
article with which he has to compete, its manufacture will
be included in this treatise. Since, however, the work of
the manufacturer is finished with the preparation of the
raw material, <i>i. e.</i>, of the air-bladders into crude glue, isinglass
and its substitutes will be referred to later on.</p>

<p>There is a material difference between isinglass and glue
manufactured from entire fishes. The raw material is, of
course, limited to certain localities. The principal point to
be observed in the manufacture of fish-glue is the removal
of the skin, which is effected by means of dilute sulphuric
acid.</p>

<p>After removal of the last traces of acid, the fatty matter
of the fishes is saponified by a treatment with milk of lime
frequently renewed. After washing out the lime, the pulpy
mass is placed in a solution of sodium hyposulphite, alum,
and common salt, where it remains for a few days. The
liquor is then drawn off and replaced by a mixture of solution
of alum, dilute sulphuric acid and nitric acid. After
macerating in this mixture for a few days, the mass is
thoroughly washed and boiled to glue, and the resulting
product clarified with sulphurous acid or alum solution.
As will be seen, the entire process is tedious, requires many
chemicals, and besides the yield of glue, which has no
specially good qualities, is small. It is used as a substitute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
for isinglass for clarifying liquids. The best proof that the
business is of but little importance is found in the fact that
no fish-glue has been exhibited at any of the late international
exhibitions.</p>

<p>The scales of large fishes, such as carp, give more favorable
results. They are treated with hydrochloric acid in a
similar manner to bones. The scales do not dissolve entirely,
a horny insoluble mass, giving no glue, remaining
behind after the solution of the glue-yielding substance.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />

<small>MANUFACTURE OF SKIN GLUE.</small></h3>


<p>The thorough preparation of the raw materials will
materially facilitate all succeeding operations, which may
be classified as follows:</p>

<p>1. Boiling the glue.</p>

<p>2. Clarifying the glue-liquor.</p>

<p>3. Forming or moulding the glue.</p>

<p>4. Drying the glue.</p>

<p>However, before entering into the description of these
operations, it will be necessary to refer to an intermediate
product, which has been previously mentioned under the
name of crude glue, and is prepared, for instance, by
tanners and manufacturers of parchment, but also forms in
some localities a special branch of industry.</p>

<p>This crude glue is actually not glue, but a glue-yielding
substance in such a state of preparation that it can be
directly used for the first operation, namely, boiling. It
consists of waste of skins and leather of all kinds, completely
cleansed, dried and limed, and in the case of leather
treated with agents for the extraction of the substances used
in the tanning. As will be readily understood, the operations
required for the preparation of this stock are virtually the
same as those described in the previous chapter for raw
materials and need not further be here referred to.</p>

<p>The bulk of such stock is prepared by tawers and manufacturers
of parchment, though a considerable quantity of
it is also derived from waste in the manufacture of gloves.
The product from the latter source is also found in commerce
under the French names <i lang="fr">Colle franche</i> or <i lang="fr">Brochette</i>.
However, if such stock is used, it is best to again immerse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
it in lime water, after which it should be thoroughly
washed.</p>

<p>The manufacture of glue from hide and leather waste
differs materially in many respects from that of bone glue,
it being the more simple process, as no other preliminary
operations than the preparation of the glue-stock are required.
The first operation is</p>


<h4>1. COOKING OR BOILING.</h4>

<p>For this operation any kind of boiler may be used, but
the materials should be supported on a perforated grid a
little distance above the bottom, so as to save them from
risk of scorching. In the centre of the grid stands a conical
pipe 2 to 3¼ feet long, perforated like the grid and communicating
with the space between the grid and the bottom of
the boiler. The height of the boiler can be increased 1 to
1½ feet by placing an annular piece upon the rim which is
bent upwards for its reception.</p>

<p>The size of the boiler depends on the quantity of raw
material to be worked at one time. It is best to choose
boilers holding from 110 to 440 lbs. of glue-stock, and to
place two, four or more of such boilers in one hearth.</p>

<p>The manner of using such a boiler is very simple. Straw
is placed upon the false bottom in such a manner as to cover
its entire surface, and extend up the sides of the boiler at
least as far as it is touched by the flame. The object of the
straw is to serve as a filter, and protect the materials from
injury by the flame. But for the production of entirely
pure gelatine or glue, straw cannot be used, as, by boiling, it
yields a yellow coloring matter, which passes into the glue.
Barley straw gives a less intense coloring matter than rye
straw.</p>

<p>In case straw cannot be used, the material is placed in a
large bag, previously thoroughly boiled, and suspended in
the boiler so as not to touch the sides. By this means
scorching is prevented even if the fire touches the bottom
as well as the sides of the boiler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>The boiler having been heaped with material so high as
to overflow the brim and fill the annular piece placed upon
it, is filled with water as far as touched by the fire. The
fire may now be started. The hearth in which the boiler
is placed should, of course, be so constructed that the gases
are uniformly distributed and the water quickly brought to
the boiling-point. When the water commences to boil,
bubbles of steam ascend from the space beneath the grid
and, passing through the perforations of the conical pipe,
penetrate the glue-stock. Thus the first formation of glue
takes place, and the stock begins to settle down gradually
as it goes into solution. The stock heaped up in the annular
piece also sinks down gradually, and being partly
heated by the hot vapors and thus prepared for solution, is
finally submerged in the boiling solution and becomes soon
entirely dissolved.</p>

<p>Waste of hide and horn piths are completely dissolved in
five to seven hours. No more water should be used than is
absolutely required for cooking the entire quantity of stock,
because too much water renders the solution too thin and
gives a jelly of little consistency and difficult to dry. Concentrating
the glue solution by continued boiling is bad
practice, as it is detrimental to the resulting product by
reason of the glutin undergoing a gradual transformation.</p>

<p>It is best to start with a slow fire to give the stock time
to soften and thus prepare it for solution. When somewhat
softened, the mass is brought to boiling and the latter kept
up, gently and uniformly, until solution is complete. Solution
is promoted by careful stirring, but care should be had
not to disarrange the straw upon the grid and on the sides
of the boiler as this would interfere with proper filtration of
the glue solution.</p>

<p>The duration of cooking depends on the nature of the raw
materials. Scraps of skin from young animals, antlers,
sheep trotters, etc., dissolve in three to four hours, while
waste from ox and horse hides, or bones from old animals,
require six to eight hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p>The progress of the operation is readily ascertained by
pouring a small sample of the gelatinous fluid in half an eggshell,
and setting it aside for a few minutes to cool. If a
clear and consistent jelly be obtained, boiling has been
carried on to a sufficient extent, and the liquid is drawn off.
Any undissolved glue-stock remaining upon the straw filter
can be boiled by itself, and the resulting gelatinous liquor
utilized in the next boiling.</p>

<p>It is evident that quick and uniform solution of the
materials, which enhances the quality of the glue, is promoted
by comminuting the glue-stock either by grinding,
stamping, or mechanical means.</p>

<p>The succeeding clarification of the glue is much facilitated
by removing while boiling the scum, consisting of
fat, coagulated albumen, lime-soap, accidental admixtures,
and other impurities. Before drawing off the gelatinous
liquor it is advisable to withdraw the fire and allow the
contents of the boiler to rest for fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>The residue remaining upon the straw filter consists of
hair, lime-soap, undissolved particles of hide and bones,
lime, etc., and is utilized, after repeated boiling, as fertilizer
or for the manufacture of gas.</p>

<p>The mode of glue boiling above described is the oldest and
at present is only in use in small establishments. Fig. 11
represents a convenient apparatus for the purpose. It consists
of three boilers upon as many different levels. The lower
boiler, <i>b</i>, serves for the settling and clarification of the glue.
It communicates with the second boiler, <i>a</i>, which contains the
material to be acted on, by means of a pipe provided with
a stopcock, and is sufficiently heated by a small fire to keep
the glue liquid without allowing it to reach ebullition. The
upper boiler, <i>c</i>, which is heated by the waste heat of the
chimney, serves as an economical reservoir for hot water.
The end of the discharge-pipe of the settling boiler is provided
with a filter of woven wire. As the sides and bottom
of the second boiler are lined with straw, which acts as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
preliminary filter, the glue runs off quite clear from the
settling boiler.</p>

<p>When this mode of manufacture is adopted, two boilings
can be made per day, under favorable circumstances, so
that, if the boiler has a capacity of 220 lbs. of stock, which
will yield from 110 to 132 lbs. of dry glue, the daily fabrication
will be about 220 lbs. of finished product.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p047.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In larger plants, the above described mode of extracting
the glue-stock with water has been superseded by the use
of steam in a cylindrical wrought-iron boiler, twice as high
as wide, and capable of withstanding a pressure of three
atmospheres. The boiler is furnished with a perforated
false bottom underneath which terminates a steam pipe. It
is filled from above with previously softened glue-stock and
the charging hole hermetically closed. Steam is then
gradually admitted and exerts at once a dissolving influence
upon the stock. A portion of the steam condenses and
forms with the dissolved glue-stock a concentrated jelly
which collects between the true and false bottoms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>For the escape of air a cock is provided which is closed
as soon as steam commences to escape from it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p048.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The advantages of this process are obvious. A larger
quantity of glue-stock can be extracted than in the boiler
previously described, and there is no danger of injury by
scorching and consequent damage to the color of the glue.
More highly concentrated solutions are obtained in a shorter
time, and the spoiling of the glue solution by too long continued
cooking is prevented by drawing off the solution as
quickly as formed. The escaping hot vapors may be utilized
for drying the glue, softening the raw material, etc.,
the entire quantity of heat being thus utilized. A further
great advantage of this method is that there is less annoyance
from badly-smelling vapors than when boiling is done
over an open fire. A number of such boilers can be ar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>ranged
in one room and supplied from a common steam
boiler.</p>

<p>Fig. 12 represents a boiler for extracting glue-stock with
the use of steam. It is provided with a lid, <i>D</i>, which is
removed for charging the boiler. The aperture, <i>E</i>, in front,
serves for the removal of the residue. Above the true bottom
there is another false bottom, perforated and movable,
which can be covered with straw for preliminary filtration.
The steam reaches the glue-stock through a pipe which
passes through the actual and false bottoms, and is perforated
above the latter. The resulting jelly collects between
the true and false bottoms, where it is less exposed
to the action of hot steam. The escaping steam passes
through the pipe, <i>F</i>, which is provided with a stock-cock.
The pressure in the boiler is indicated by the manometer,
<i>K</i>. After throwing the materials into the boiler they can
be covered with warm water, or, after the lid is closed,
warm water is introduced from a reservoir through a special
pipe and distributed over the material through a rose.</p>

<p>The boiler stands upon a frame sufficiently high to allow
of conveniently placing a vessel under the pipe <i>G</i>, through
which the jelly is discharged. The vessel, when full, is
conveyed to the settling vat, or the arrangement may be
such that the jelly is directly run into the settling vat.</p>

<p>In many large plants open jacketed pans heated by steam
are still used for treating the material. Fig. 13 shows an
arrangement with two of such pans; of course one, or a
larger number may be used, according to requirement. In
the illustration the pan <i>I</i> on the left is shown in front
view, and the pan <i>II</i> on the right, in section. <i>K<sub>1</sub></i> is the
actual pan enclosed by the jacket <i>K</i>. Steam circulates in
the space between pan and jacket, whereby the stock in the
pan is heated. <i>K<sub>1</sub></i>, in addition, is furnished with a steam
coil <i>S</i>, which may, however, be omitted.</p>

<p>The steam enters through the pipe <i>D</i>, the space between
pan and jacket, passes into the coil <i>S</i>, and escapes at <i>b</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
The water formed by the condensation of steam in the space
between pan and jacket, as well as that which runs off at <i>b</i>
from the coil <i>S</i>, is carried away by the pipe <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>The pipe <i>L</i> serves for conveying hot water to the pans,
and the pipe <i>F</i> for the discharge of the finished glue liquor.
The stirrer <i>R</i>, is furnished with two paddles, and is set in
motion by a transmission on the ceiling of the room. It
serves for keeping the stock in the pans constantly agitated,
solution being thus very much promoted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p050.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The mode of working with this apparatus is very simple.
Water being admitted into the pan through <i>L</i>, the glue-stock
is introduced and the mass brought to boiling by admitting
steam. The finished glue-liquor is from time to
time drawn off through the pipe <i>F</i> into the settling vessel.</p>

<p>It is generally preferred not to concentrate the glue-liquor
in the pans to such a degree as required to obtain a
jelly, which after cooling, can be immediately moulded,
experience having shown that less concentrated liquors can
be more readily and better clarified, and yield a lighter and
more transparent glue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Lambert gives the following process of cooking:
The skins are taken to the glue-boiler, which is an
open vessel, 8 feet in diameter at the top and 7 feet deep,
and provided with a perforated false bottom, through the
center of which passes a two-inch pipe, one end dipping
below a layer of water at the bottom, the other projecting
about half the height of the boiler, this part being covered
with a perforated hood to spray the liquor through the
mass. The skins are placed on the false bottom and the
added water at the bottom of the boiler is brought to the
boil by means of a steam pipe. The steam not being able
to escape quickly through the dense mass of glue-stock
above, exerts a pressure on the water, forces it through the
pipe, to be sprayed through the mass, and ultimately works
its way to the bottom of the boiler to be forced up again.
This continual circulation of the hot liquor rapidly dissolves
the gelatinous matter, and when a strength of 18 per cent.
dry glue is reached, the first run is made to the evaporating
pan, the liquor passing through a filter of fine shavings, to
remove any suspended matter. Fresh water is added to the
boiler, and the boiling renewed. Three extractions are
usually made, the last being used for size.</p>

<p>In order to avoid annoyance to the neighborhood from
foul odors, Terne’s glue-boiler shown in Fig. 14 may be
recommended. The lead-lined iron boiler <i>A</i>, with manholes
<i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, on top and side, is furnished with a false
perforated bottom upon which the glue-stock is placed.
Underneath the false bottom lies the coil <i>E</i> with valve-box
<i>e</i>. The boiler is filled through the upper manhole with
glue-stock and water admitted, steam being at the same
time introduced in the coil and in order to quickly heat the
water, direct steam is also admitted to the boiler through
the pipe <i>F</i> and cock <i>G</i>. When the water is boiling the
cocks <i>G</i> and <i>F</i> are closed, the coil furnishing now sufficient
heat. During boiling some steam is allowed to escape
through the partly-opened cock <i>L</i>, all badly-smelling gases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
being thereby carried to the fire-box of a boiler where they
are burned. When boiling is finished, the glue liquor
remains for a short time in the boiler to allow the melted fat
to separate on the surface, the cocks <i>K<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>K<sub>5</sub></i> and serving for
drawing off the fat. The insoluble residues of the glue-stock
remain upon the false bottom and are taken out
through the manhole <i>C</i>.</p>

<h4>2. CLARIFYING THE GLUE-LIQUOR.</h4>

<p>The clearness of glue, <i>i. e.</i>, its freedom from undissolved
substances, is by no means a criterion of its value as an
agglutinant, since pulverulent inorganic substances (white
lead) are frequently intentionally introduced into some
varieties, for instance into Russian glue, without injury to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
their adhesive power. But as a turbid appearance may
also be an indication of unsoundness and decomposition,
the manufacturer endeavors by all means to obtain a clear
product.</p>

<p>A strict distinction should be made between clearness and
color. Very dark-colored glue may be very clear, and a
very pale variety the reverse, yet both possess excellent
qualities. Both properties, clearness and light color, cannot
be obtained by the same process.</p>

<p>Clearness will be first referred to. If the glue-stock has
been properly prepared by rendering adhering particles of
blood and fat innoxious by liming and subsequent careful
washing, the separation of the few remaining impurities,
which may have passed through the straw filter, is readily
effected by allowing the liquor to stand, care being had to
keep it liquid as long as possible to give the grease time to
rise and the flocculent and fibrous impurities to settle.
This is best effected in a wooden vat surrounded by a
wooden or sheet-iron jacket, the intermediate space between
jacket and vat being filled with a non-conductor of heat, or,
if required, it may be heated by the introduction of steam.
The grease is skimmed off as it rises, and when the solid
particles have settled the liquor is drawn off through a pipe
placed a short distance above the bottom of the vat.</p>

<p>The size of the clarifying vat depends on the size of the
boiler. It is, however, best to have two vats for each
boiler, in order to keep the first liquor, which is always
clearer and more concentrated, separate from the last run.
To be able to draw the upper layers of purer liquor into
cooling boxes by themselves, the vats are provided with faucets
at different heights.</p>

<p>To prevent putrefaction of the liquor which readily sets
in during settling at a higher temperature, the vats should
be kept scrupulously clean, and from time to time rinsed
with clean, hot water. It is also advisable to line them
with sheet-iron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>Should the above-described mechanical separation not
prove sufficient, recourse must be had to other means.
Alum and sulphate of alumina have long been used for
clarifying, 1 lb. of either of them, pulverized, added to
every 300 gallons of liquor, being as a rule sufficient.
Either of these chemicals removes the albuminous and extractive
constituents of the solution, and converts the dissolved
free lime into sulphate of lime, which settles readily,
and prevents putrefaction of the glue solution while drying
under unfavorable circumstances. The quantity of alum
mentioned above does not impair the quality of the glue.</p>

<p>Albumen is sometimes used for the better qualities of
glue, and generally for gelatine, but a cheaper substitute is
fresh blood, which contains albumen and fibrin. Dry
albumen is dissolved in cold water, or white of egg is used
direct, if procurable. Before adding either of these substances,
the liquor is cooled to 130° F., and the clarifier
well stirred in; then the temperature is raised to about
200° F., when coagulation occurs, and the precipitate entangles
the impurities and falls to the bottom, requiring,
however, from twelve to twenty-four hours to clear. It is
said that glues clarified with albumen have a characteristic
soapy smell and show a tendency to foam.</p>

<p>The precipitation of the lime might be better effected by
oxalic acid, and the organic substances removed as scum by
adding to the boiling mass some astringent matter, such as
a decoction of oak bark or hops; but the purification has,
in either case, to be done at the expense of glutin.</p>

<p>A glue liquor, which does not clarify by these means, is
not sound, and is derived either from spoiled raw materials,
or such as have not been thoroughly prepared, or has been
injured in boiling.</p>

<p>A far more difficult matter than the removal of mechanical
admixtures is to free the liquor from the coloring substances
from which it derives its color, and to discolor it
without injury to the characteristic qualities of the glue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<p>The use of animal charcoal for such large quantities of
somewhat thickly-fluid solutions, which are liable to spoil
at the high temperature at which they would have to be
filtered, is very difficult, and the result not favorable, except
the solutions could be successfully deprived of their
tendency to putrefy. The use of carbolic acid is also in
this case the only means of removing the great tendency of
the liquor to putrefy, and hence, if the liquor is to be discolored
by treatment with animal charcoal, it can only be
done without danger to the glue, by mixing it with carbolic
acid.</p>

<p>The object is more easily effected by bleaching the raw
materials previous to boiling them to glue.</p>

<p>This is accomplished by placing the glue-stock, thoroughly
limed and while still moist, in a bath of chloride of
lime, not too strong, as otherwise the solution of the materials
becomes difficult. A bath of the proper concentration
is made by dissolving about 9 ozs. of chloride of lime in
sufficient water to cover 110 lbs. of glue-stock. After one
hour add sufficient hydrochloric acid to obtain an acid reaction,
which is recognized by litmus-paper dipped in the
bath turning red.</p>

<p>Although the glue-stock is not bleached entirely through
by this process, the thin portions and outsides of the thick
material acquire a lighter color, and the first run of glue
solution will have a light color and can then be treated further
without much difficulty.</p>

<p>Sulphurous acid has been successfully used for the production
of colorless glue without the necessity of boiling.</p>

<p>Waste of hides and skins is the only available material
for this process. Place the waste in water until putrefaction
sets in. When this is the case wash the material in a
bag or wicker basket in running water. Then pour 2½
parts of sulphurous acid over 12 parts of wet material, mix
the whole thoroughly and let it stand in a hermetically
closed vessel for 24 hours. Now draw off the acid, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
after washing the material thoroughly repeat the operation.
When the vessel containing the mixture of material and
sulphurous acid is opened for the second time the foul odor
should be entirely superseded by that of sulphurous acid,
this being a sure indication of the correct execution of the
process. Wash the material, and, after squeezing, throw it
into a vat large enough not to be filled by it more than
two-thirds full. After filling the vat with water allow the
mass to digest at a temperature of 109.4° F. for 24 hours.
The result will be a gelatinous solution, which is drawn off
and converted into glue. The undissolved residue is transformed
into gelatinous solution by pouring water over it
and allowing it to stand at a somewhat higher temperature.</p>

<p>For carrying out this process and that of bleaching with
chloride of lime it is best to use a vat provided with a stirring
apparatus, somewhat like a hollander used by pape-rmakers,
as being most suitable for washing, disintegrating
and mixing the material.</p>

<p>Glue-liquor may also be successfully bleached with sulphurous
acid, and in speaking later on of the manufacture
of bone glue, a very practical apparatus for this purpose
will be described.</p>

<p>Glue-liquor bleached by sulphurous acid clarifies very
readily and is protected from spoiling. The resulting glue
remains, however, quite acid, and cannot be used for all
purposes, especially not in combination with colors, chemicals,
etc., upon which the acid has a destructive effect.</p>


<h4>3. FORMING OR MOULDING THE GLUE.</h4>

<p>After clarifying, the liquor is run into moulds of deal
wood or sheet iron, lightly joined and of a rectangular form,
slightly converging towards the bottom so as to allow the
more ready detachment of their contents. They are about
3.25 feet long, 10 inches wide at the top, and 7¾ inches at
the bottom, and 5 inches deep. When very regular cakes
of glue are desired, cross grooves of the required shape are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
cut in the bottoms. After being well cleansed and ranged
upon a level the boxes are filled to the brim through large
funnels with strainer cloths affixed to their barrels. It is
best to place them upon perfectly clean stone flagging
slightly inclined towards a reservoir for the reception of
such portions of their contents as may run over. The
apartment in which the work is performed should be clean
and airy, a dry cellar being the best for the purpose. In
place of a large number of boxes, a shallow vessel lined
with sheet-iron and capable of holding the entire quantity
of liquor is sometimes used, from which the solid jelly is
cut out in cubic masses, which are further divided.</p>

<p>This arrangement can only be recommended for establishments
where but one variety of glue is produced, and
the different layers in the clarifying vat are not separated
according to their clearness. Before running the liquor
into the boxes the latter should be moistened with water,
or, if made of wood, coated with oil, stearine, or paraffin to
prevent the liquor from penetrating the wood and the
solidifying glue from adhering to the sides.</p>

<p>After the solidification of the glue, which generally takes
place in twelve to eighteen hours, the boxes are inverted
upon a table with a smooth top of wood or stone previously
wetted, so as to prevent the adherence of the gelatinous
cake to its surface. To detach it from the sides of the
boxes the moistened blade of a large knife is generally
used.</p>

<p>Cutting the cubes of glue into commercial cakes or
sheets is readily accomplished by observing the following
instructions:—</p>

<p>The shape of the cakes depends principally on custom.
The consumer is used to a certain variety of glue, and if it
is not offered to him in the customary shape, he might
refuse it and take his custom elsewhere. The quality of
the glue is the next point to be considered. If very dark,
it is advisable to cut the glue into thin cakes, and if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
turbid, into thick ones, in order to make this defect the
less apparent. Thicker cakes can also be cut if the conditions
for drying them are favorable, and thinner ones if the
reverse is the case.</p>

<p>The mass is first divided by a steel or brass wire stretched
over a frame, like a bow saw, into horizontal layers. The
size of these layers is regulated by guides which are placed
at distances corresponding with the desired thickness of the
cake of glue. Instead of one wire, as many as the cakes
of glue to be cut, can be stretched over the frame, which
is best made of iron and provided with conical pins by
means of which the wires can be tightened, in the same
manner as piano strings, when they have become slack by
use.</p>

<p>The width and thickness of the cakes of glue are regulated
by the distance of the wires from each other, and the
length by the width of the box. The cakes thus formed
are dexterously lifted from the block with the moist blade
of a large knife and placed upon nets.</p>

<p>Instead of using wooden or sheet-iron cooling-boxes, it is
recommended to pour a layer of liquor of the desired thickness
of the glue cakes upon large polished stone slabs, and
when congealed, cut it into sheets, which are placed upon
the nets to dry. The advantages of this method are
obvious. The liquor cools more quickly by being exposed
in a thin layer upon a large surface, which reduces the
danger of spoiling, and a strong evaporation of water and
consequent concentration take place. Besides, the cakes
show the smooth surface of the polished stone, and become
in a short time so hard, that when placed upon the nets,
the twine will make no impression upon them.</p>

<p>Liquors which in gelatinizing do not become very solid,
are not run into forming boxes, but upon glass or zinc
plates, and thus spread out in a thin layer, acquire sufficient
solidity to be removed cake by cake after being cut.
The plates upon which the glue is run are placed in frames<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
and laid upon a table furnished with a rim about 1 inch
deep. To accelerate gelatinization of the liquor, the table
is flooded with water before placing the plates upon it.</p>

<p>Where cooling-boxes are used, the jelly when completely
congealed is placed upon a table with a stone plate, by
inverting the boxes, and then cut into cakes. Figs. 15 and
16 represent the tools for cutting the jelly into cakes. The
block of glue is laid upon the surface <i>A</i>, Fig. 15, and the
frame, <i>B</i>, is gently drawn along in the grooves, <i>a</i>. In the
upright portion of the frame are fixed wires at such a distance
from each other as required for the thickness of the
cakes to be cut.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span></div>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p059-2.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When the block of glue has been cut in this direction, it
is divided by cuts perpendicular to the former, into cakes
of a size in which the finished product is to be brought into
commerce. The apparatus shown in Fig. 16 serves for this
purpose. The vertical bars, <i>a</i>, furnished with the wire,
<i>b b</i>, serve as guides. The sheets thus formed are lifted from
the block with the moist blade of a large knife, and laid
upon nets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>The machine shown in Figs. 17 and 18 is the invention
of Mr. J. Schneible, and it is for slicing and spreading glue-jelly
preparatory to drying, and it consists in the combination
of a reciprocating cutter with the jelly-box and a traveling
belt-carrying frame for receiving the slices as cut by
the knife.</p>

<p>Fig. 17 is a partly sectional side view of the machine,
and Fig. 18 is a cross-section of the same.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p060-1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p><i>A A</i> are side bars of the supporting frame, fitted at the
ends with cross-shafts, <i>a´</i>, carrying pulleys, <i>a a</i>, around which
are endless belts, <i>b b</i>. <i>c c</i> are slide-ways upon the bars, <i>A</i>,
and <i>d d</i> are slides carrying a cross-plate, <i>e</i>, and also a plate, <i>f</i>,
to which plate <i>e</i> is attached a knife or cutter, <i>g</i>, the cutting
edge of which is at the edge of the plate, <i>f</i>, and about the
same thickness as the slices to be cut. The cross-shaft, <i>h</i>,
is fitted in boxes on bars, <i>A</i>, and near one end thereof it is
provided with cranks at its ends, which connect by rods, <i>i</i>,
to the slides, <i>d</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p060-2.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>From the opposite ends of the slides, rods, <i>k</i>, pass to loose
arms, <i>l</i>, on the shaft at the opposite end of the machine, and
the arms, <i>l</i>, carry pawls, <i>l´</i>, that engage ratchet-wheels, <i>m</i>,
fixed on the shaft, so that the shaft, <i>h</i>, being revolved, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
slides, with plates, <i>e f</i>, are reciprocated, and at the backward
movement of the cutter the pawls engage the ratchet-wheels,
and belts, <i>b</i>, are moved a distance equal to the
movement of the knife.</p>

<p>The jelly-box, <i>n</i>, is fixed to side bars, <i>A</i>, by brackets at
its ends, as shown in Fig. 18, and is placed above the cutter
and the plate, <i>e</i>, so that when the plate, <i>f</i>, is drawn out from
beneath the box the plate, <i>e</i>, takes its place for holding up
the block of jelly.</p>

<p>In operation the block of jelly is placed in box <i>n</i>, resting
on plate <i>e</i>. A frame provided with netting—such as is used
for drying glue—is placed on belts, <i>b</i>, beneath the box, and
the shaft, <i>h</i>, being rotated by power, the cutter moves forward
and cuts a slice from the jelly. The plate, <i>f</i>, at the
same time moving away, the slice passes upon the frame,
and the return movement taking place, plate <i>f</i> is carried
beneath the jelly-block, and the belts being at the same
time moved, the frame is carried forward in position for receiving
the next slice apart from the first one. In this
manner, as slice after slice is cut, they are spread on the
frame, and the frames, when filled, are carried to the end of
the machine for removal. The plate, <i>f</i>, is adjustable, so as
to vary the thickness of the slices cut.</p>

<p>The box may be divided into cells of any size desired, so
that each movement of the knife will cut a slice from the
bottom of each cell, and the box extending the full width
of the drying frames, all the slices cut at once will be
properly spread.</p>

<p>In order to keep the plates, <i>e f</i>, moist, so as to prevent
the glue-jelly from sticking thereto, there are fitted at the
sides of the jelly-box, <i>n</i>, open-bottomed boxes, <i>o</i>, containing
fibrous material soaked with water, which, resting on plates,
<i>e f</i>, keeps their surfaces moist.</p>

<p>The machine saves the troublesome and expensive work
of spreading the jelly by hand, as has been heretofore
practiced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<p>The knife is to be attached to plate, <i>e</i>, in any suitable
manner, and the surface of plate, <i>f</i>, may be corrugated, so
as to slide on the jelly more readily.</p>

<p>The cutting apparatus patented by M. Devoulx, of Marseilles,
is much used in France. The machine stands upon
a board or table, upon which are fastened two uprights,
far enough apart to allow of the passage of a truck carrying
the glue, which is cut into cakes by blades or wires stretched
between the uprights.</p>

<p>Fig. 19 shows the perspective elevation of the machine
with its truck. The upper part is filled up for the reception
of the glue to be cut up into cakes. The sides are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
omitted in this figure in order to admit of a better explanation
of the separate parts.</p>

<p>Fig. 20 gives the same view, except that the truck,

is fastened with the pin, <i>k</i>. This upper part of the truck
is fastened to the back part of the truck by means of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
screw, which allows it to be set higher or lower, according
to the size of the block of jelly to be cut; <i>m</i> is the bar of a
rack fastened to the truck, and serves for moving the latter.

</div>

<p>Two boards, one on each side of the truck, serve to keep
the block of jelly in position, and guide the truck.</p>

<p>With this machine 120,000 to 130,000 cakes can be cut
in five or six hours.</p>


<h4>3. DRYING THE CAKES OF GLUE.</h4>

<p>Drying the cakes is without doubt the most precarious
part of the manufacture. The jelly contains a large quantity
of water which, to prevent decomposition of the jelly
before it is converted into glue, must be evaporated as
quickly as possible. In favorable weather, drying may be
accomplished either in the open air or in covered sheds.</p>

<p>Drying in the open air is connected with many inconveniences,
for if the sun strikes the cakes of jelly when they
still contain a large quantity of water, they may become
soft so as to run through the meshes of the net, or they may
dry so quickly as to prevent them from contracting to their
proper size without numerous cracks and fissures. If frost
supervenes, numerous cracks may be formed in the cakes
from the congelation of their water, or a shower of rain may
cause much work and damage. In consideration of all
these inconveniences, it is best to conduct the operation in
a drying-room.</p>

<p>To insure a constant circulation of air, which is abso<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>lutely
necessary for the expulsion of the aqueous vapor
caused by the evaporation of such a large quantity of water,
the drying-room should be at least 10 feet high, even if intended
for summer use only, and the windows be provided
with Venetian blinds so as to shut out the sun, if necessary,
without disturbing the circulation of air.</p>

<p>To dry the cakes in heated rooms in winter is a more
difficult matter, as provision has to be made for the removal
of the aqueous vapor, and a current of warm dry air has to
be kept up at the same time. But such a room is an absolute
necessity for the manufacturer on a large scale, who, in order
to carry on his business without interruption throughout
the entire year, must be independent of the changes of wind
and weather.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p065.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The size of the drying-room should be proportional to
the daily production. Constructions are fitted up with the
requisite frames for the reception of the glue cakes, and are
heated by steam pipes arranged along the walls. In the
floor in the immediate neighborhood of the steam pipes are
openings, which can be opened and shut at pleasure, for the
admission of fresh dry air. The latter on entering the
room is heated, and after passing over the frames and absorbing
water from the glue cakes, escapes through openings
in the ceiling to a space above it from which it is withdrawn
by means of ventilators in the roof. A constant
change of air must be kept up. The quick drying of the
glue is of the utmost importance, as otherwise the jelly
putrefies either entirely or partially, and the glue acquires
a turbid and mean appearance. Too much heat causes the
cakes to bend and crack. The cakes are laid upon wide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>meshed
nets of twine stretched in frames 6½ to 8 feet long
and 3¼ feet wide. Fig. 24 represents the form of nets
commonly used. The nets are placed upon frames, such as
shown in Fig. 25, arranged around the drying-room in the
neighborhood of the steam pipes and air flues. As the
cakes have to be occasionally turned upside down upon the
nets, the latter must be placed at convenient distances, one
above the other in the frames.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p066.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The use of twine netting has been found to be attended
with many disadvantages, the principal ones of which are
given by S. Rideal as follows:</p>

<p>1. “Being freely handled in the making, the netting is
almost always impregnated with dangerous organisms
which penetrate the moist glue cakes, and cause moulding
or putrefaction. When this occurs, it is usually attributed
to a state of the atmosphere, but if the cakes are examined,
the alteration will generally be found to originate along the
lines made by the netting. The fault could be cured by
sterilizing the net for an hour at 212° to 248° F. in a hot
oven, but besides the expense, the fibre is thereby weakened.
Moreover, the spores of a few bacteria, such as
<i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, which is widely distributed and has the
power of liquefying gelatine, will bear a heat of 248° F. for
over an hour, and still be capable of growing.</p>

<p>2. “However smooth the fibre, the glue will stick in
places, leaving small remains, which being hygroscopic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
become ’sour,’ and set up the objectionable bacterial changes
in the subsequent batches.</p>

<p>3. “Owing to sagging, rotting, scouring, or wearing into
holes, the life of cotton or hemp netting is so short that the
constant renewal is a considerable item. A whole batch is
frequently spoilt by the fault of a net. In some works,
heaps of old netting are found, which become very putrid
in the rain and sun, and give rise to mysterious bacterial
inroads in the factory. In others they are regularly burnt
under the boilers.</p>

<p>4. “The considerable overlap or selvedge required for
securing the edges of the net involves a waste of the area,
and also some difficulty in refixing.”</p>

<p>For this reason metallic netting has been largely adopted.
The best material has proved to be a heavily galvanized
iron-wire netting having no less than 15 to 25 per cent. of
its weight of zinc. It can be strengthened by longitudinal
and transverse wires or ribs. It must be examined by the
microscope to see that it is perfectly free from holes or
cracks, and should last at least two years in constant use.</p>

<p>The temperature of the drying-room requires careful regulation,
and should never be allowed to rise above 68° to
77° F., as otherwise the glue would soften and run through
the meshes of the net, or adhere so firmly to the twine as to
require the nets to be put in hot water for its separation.
Dryness of air is of far greater importance in the drying
process than a high temperature. To promote this dryness
of air and prevent the aqueous vapor from condensing,
evaporating, and again condensing upon the cold walls of
the room, they are wainscoted. Thus protected by a bad
conductor, they acquire a higher temperature, and the
aqueous vapor, instead of being precipitated upon them, is
carried off by the air-currents.</p>

<p>As the cakes placed in the immediate neighborhood of
the steam pipes and near the floor where the dry air enters,
dry quickest, the nets containing them are shifted after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
some time to a higher part of the drying-room and their
former places filled with cakes still wet. When the cakes
are dry, they are finally desiccated in a room at a higher
temperature, which serves to harden and improve them.</p>

<p>In modern times drying-rooms have been almost entirely
abandoned and in this country long drying galleries are
used, sometimes 250 feet in length and 6 to 8 feet square,
with traveling platforms on rails carrying the sheets of glue
on stout galvanized netting. Wood is found to be a better
material for the galleries than stone or brick.</p>

<p>Figs. 26 to 28 show an apparatus for drying glue which
is the invention of W. A. Hoeveller.</p>

<p>Fig. 26 is a plan section, and Fig. 27 a side elevation in
section, of this improved drying-alley. Fig. 28 is an end
view in section.</p>

<p>The form and arrangement are as follows:—</p>

<p><i>A B</i> represent the two parts of the alley, separated by the
partition <i>C</i>, which is shorter than the alley, so as to leave
a communicating space at both ends.</p>

<p>At the front of section <i>A</i>, is located a blower, <i>D</i>, actuated
by a steam-engine or other motor, <i>E</i>, also located within
the walls of the alley. The whole current from blower <i>D</i>,
is directed through section <i>A</i> of the alley, whence it turns
into section <i>B</i>, and comes back through it, to be again
drawn into and forced out of the blower into section <i>A</i>.
By this means the contained air of the alley is set in continuous
motion through the two sections successively, and
as the structure is made as air-tight as practicable in such
cases, the air remains unchanged until the doors <i>F</i>, or either
of them, are opened to discharge the vitiated air and let in
the fresh.</p>

<p>In sections <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, is placed the railway <i>a a</i>, to admit
of the convenient movement of the contents in process of
drying, which are generally set on cars or buggies.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p069.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In section <i>A</i>, in front of blower <i>D</i>, is placed a steam or
other heating device, <i>G</i>, which may be of any form or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
design adapted to allow the air from blower <i>D</i> to pass
through it and to heat such air while passing therethrough.
The inventor prefers the radiating coil for such purpose,
the steam entering at <i>b</i>, and emerging at <i>c</i>. At the other
end of the alley, which by the double construction is in
section <i>B</i>, just back of the blower and heating-coil, there is
placed a condensing-coil, <i>H</i>, of a construction similar to coil
<i>G</i>, and having inlet <i>d</i>, and outlet <i>e</i>. Through this condenser
there is kept flowing a refrigerating liquid or brine,
which renders the condenser very cold. The continuous
current of air from the blower passes over the contents of
the cars or trays in the alley and takes up moisture in its
passage. After such passage the air is charged with moisture
and comes in contact with the coils of the condenser <i>H</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
upon which the charge of moisture is condensed, and the
air emerges dry again, enters the blower, and is again made
the vehicle by which the moisture of the glue or other contents
is transported to and deposited on the condenser.</p>

<p>In drying glue by this method do not use the steam-coil
at the first stage of drying a charge, as the drying should
not be effected too rapidly; but as soon as the product
begins to stiffen properly, admit the steam to the coil <i>G</i>,
and thereafter the operation is continuous, as above described.</p>

<p>By doubling up the alley into two sections, as shown, the
inventor is enabled to erect the alley in a more contracted
space. In a length of ninety feet he obtains the benefit of
a single alley one hundred and eighty feet long. Section
<i>B</i> may, if desired, be located on top of section <i>A</i>. Doors
may be located wherever desired, to facilitate the movement
of the trays or cars and the placing of them in and their
removal from the alley.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p070.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>By the above apparatus the drying can be perfected in a
very much shorter time than can be done by the old alleys,
and operations can be conducted in hot weather without
hindrance from the condition of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>In cases where the atmosphere is dry enough to dispense
with the heater and the condenser, the inventor can throw
the doors <i>F</i> wide open, extend the partition <i>C</i> out to that
end of the alley, and then preserve a continuous forced draft
of sufficiently dry air in both alleys for the purpose. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
there are many days during the year fine enough to give
reasonably dry air, operations can be conducted with the
blower alone in this way, and thus economize the steam and
the refrigerating-brine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p071.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Figs. 29 and 30 show a longitudinal section, with upper
and ground floor plans of a modern drying-house, as given
by Thomas Lambert. In the ground floor the whole of the
liquors are jellied in coolers, and then cut into cakes by
the two cutting machines in the centre. Here a hoist, <i>E</i>,
Fig. 30, is placed which carries the cut cakes on “glasses”
to the floor above. This forms the drying-floor, and is partitioned
off in three divisions, running nearly the length of
the building. The two outer divisions form the tunnels
proper, and at the ends are fixed two powerful revolving
fans, driven at high speed and drawing the air through the
tunnels at a high rate. At the opposite ends of the fans
are fixed a series of 6-inch pipes, heated up by waste steam,
and the air passing between is warmed up to any desired
temperature, of necessity below 78° F. In the center pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>age
a number of girls are employed in transferring the cut
cakes to the nets, which are built upon a carriage running
on a small railway. The carriage with the complement
of filled nets is run to the end of the division, transferred to
the lower railway, <i>C</i>, by which it is carried either to the
right or left hand tunnels as desired; the glue when dried
on the nets is run to the other end and by another lower
railway brought to the middle division, and ultimately by
the hoist raised to a large store-room, seen in section, where
the glue is sorted and bagged. At the end of the store-room
is placed a grinding machine, and all the off-color and
twisted cakes are ground to a powder and sold as powdered
glue. The manufacturer by varying the size of the cake, its
thickness, and its color, may make any number of grades
from the same boiling.</p>

<p>Fleck proposes to accelerate the drying of glue by utilizing
the water-absorbing power of some salts, such as Epsom
and Glauber’s salts, ammonium sulphate, crystallized acid
sodium sulphate, etc., for the purpose of withdrawing water
from the glue cakes. For the practical application of this
principal a shallow, water-tight, wooden box is required.
The bottom of the box is sprinkled with a layer of the
water-absorbing salt about half an inch deep, and covered
with a moist linen cloth. Upon this is placed the jelly cut
into sheets and also covered with a moist cloth, a layer of
salt being finally scattered over it. After standing for a
few hours, the box is slightly inclined and the salt solution
allowed to drain off through a hole in the bottom, the
dropping ceasing in from 12 to 18 hours. If now the upper
cloth is taken off with its layer of salt, the glue beneath it
will be found so far deprived of its moisture that when placed
in the sun or exposed to other heat, it will become completely
dry in a short time without either melting or spoiling,
and in winter may be laid upon drying-floors with the
same result. The salt-solution formed may be evaporated
to crystallization and the salt thus obtained be again used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>After the treatment with the salt, the jelly contains 70
to 75 per cent. of anhydrous glue, while the content in jelly
not thus treated varies between 7 and 28 per cent. according
to the concentration of the liquor from which it has
been derived. It is claimed that the adhesive power of the
glue is not injured by this treatment.</p>

<p>Commercial glue must not only be thoroughly dry, but
should also present a good appearance, showing especially
lustre. However, after drying, the glue is dull, spotted,
dusty and sometimes even mouldy. To give a good lustrous
appearance the dry cakes are dipped in warm water and
replaced upon the nets to dry.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br />

<small>MANUFACTURE OF BONE-GLUE.</small></h3>


<p>The manufacture of bone-glue differs chiefly from that of
skin-glue in the processes employed for the conversion of
the glue-yielding tissues. This conversion may be effected
by boiling the bones with water, or subjecting them to the
action of steam, or by first extracting their mineral constituents
with acid, and boiling the remaining cartilaginous
mass with water until dissolved.</p>

<p>When the finest quality of all varieties of glue, namely,
colorless gelatine, is to be manufactured, the bones should
not be comminuted in a stamping mill, because in consequence
of the unavoidable development of heat, they acquire
a slightly empyreumatic odor which adheres to the gelatine
prepared from them, and cannot be removed.</p>

<p>In factories working on a small scale, the bones are comminuted
by hand, being placed upon a grate-like support
of heavy iron rods and crushed with a wooden hammer, the
face of which is studded with big-headed nails. In larger
establishments the crushing rolls previously described are
used, and in order to lessen the effect of heating as much as
possible, the crushed bones are allowed to fall directly into
a vessel filled with water.</p>

<p>Fat being a very valuable constituent of bones, it should
be gained as completely as possible, by boiling or steaming
the bones, or by extracting them by means of a solvent,
such as benzine or carbon disulphide.</p>


<h4>1. BOILING BONES.</h4>

<p>This is the older and more incomplete process of extracting
the fat. The bones are placed in a boiler, covered with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
water so that it stands a few inches deep over them, and the
whole is boiled over an open fire. The melted fat collecting
on the surface of the water is skimmed off. By boiling, a
portion of the glue-yielding substance is, of course, converted
into glue, and passes into the water. In order not
to lose this glue, the same water is repeatedly used for boiling
fresh quantities of bones, and is finally used for feeding
pigs. By this method 4 to 5 per cent. of fat is at the utmost
obtained.</p>

<p>The bone fat obtained by direct boiling of the bones, is,
if entirely fresh material has not been used, of very inferior
quality. It is dark yellow to deep brown and of a disagreeable
odor. It is only fit for certain purposes, and to
be utilized in the manufacture of soap has to undergo a
special process of purification, whereby it is rendered white
and odorless.</p>


<h4>2. STEAMING BONES.</h4>

<p>In order to obtain a larger quantity of fat than is possible
by boiling, the bones are preferably steamed, <i>i. e.</i>, subjected
to the action of high-pressure steam. This is effected
in a closed cylinder of thick boiler-plate, into which steam
of ½ to 1 atmosphere pressure is admitted. The cylinder is
provided with a perforated false bottom upon which the
bones are placed. By steaming for two or three hours, all
the fat is extracted from the bones and collects, together
with the condensed water formed by the steam coming in
contact with the cold bones, underneath the false bottom.
However, by the continued action of high-pressure steam
upon the bones, a considerable portion of the glue-yielding
tissue is converted into glue, which passes into the resulting
liquor. This, however, is no drawback if only fat and glue
are to be obtained from the bones, since by continued
steaming, a liquor still richer in glue results, and need only
be evaporated. But, as a rule, the greater portion of the
bones, especially the granulated parts, are to be utilized in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
the manufacture of animal charcoal, and, hence, great care
has to be observed in steaming.</p>

<p>Animal charcoal is produced by calcining bones in vessels
from which the air is excluded, whereby the glue-yielding
tissue is converted into carbon, which is distributed
upon the bone-earth. Since the value of animal
charcoal depends on the quantity of carbon it contains, a
product prepared from bones highly steamed, will evidently
be of little value, as a considerable portion of the glue-yielding
substance has been converted into glue.</p>

<p>If the bones are to be used for the production of animal
charcoal they should be subjected to the action of high-pressure
steam only long enough to extract the fat, but the
resulting glue-liquor is very thin and difficult to work.
The watery glue-liquor is first drawn off, and the fat which
comes last is caught by itself. The thin glue-liquor is
evaporated in vacuum.</p>


<h4>3. EXTRACTION OF BONES.</h4>

<p>To avoid the loss of glue-yielding substance which is unavoidable
in steaming bones, even if only for a short time,
in many plants the fat is now extracted by treating the
bones with benzine or carbon disulphide. No loss of glue-yielding
substance being involved by this process, bones
thus treated yield the best quality of animal charcoal.</p>

<p>The fat obtained by extraction with carbon disulphide
has such a disagreeable odor as to render it almost worthless.
In addition this solvent is very volatile, consequently
very inflammable, and is also very poisonous. For these
reasons its use for the extraction of fat has been almost entirely
abandoned.</p>

<p>Figs. 31 and 32 show an apparatus for the use of benzine
which is the invention of Messrs. Wm. Adamson and
Charles F. A. Simonis, of Philadelphia, Pa. It is for the
purpose of treating animal and vegetable substances with
hydrocarbons for extracting therefrom oily, fatty and resin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>ous
matter; and the object of this invention is to cause
hydrocarbons to trickle through such substances instead of
flooding the same, so that it will take up the oily, fatty and
resinous matter without any of the albuminous or gelatinous
ingredients.</p>

<p>Fig. 31 is a vertical section of apparatus wherewith this
invention may be carried into effect; Fig. 32, an inverted
plan view of part of Fig. 31.</p>

</div>

<p><i>A</i> is a vessel, preferably of cylindrical form, and containing
an upper perforated diaphragm, <i>a</i>, and lower perforated
diaphragm, <i>b</i>, the former having a central opening, through
which the material to be treated may be introduced between
the two diaphragms, and this opening having a detachable
perforated cover, <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>On the top of the vessel there is an opening, <i>e</i>, furnished
with a detachable cover, <i>f</i>, and at the bottom of the vessel
there is an outlet-pipe, <i>h</i>, furnished with a suitable cock or
valve, <i>i</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>Liquid hydrocarbon, preferable such as is of a volatile
character—benzine, benzole, or gasoline, for instance—is
introduced into the vessel above the diaphragm <i>a</i> through
a pipe, <i>H</i>, and perforated ring, <i>I</i>, or otherwise, the hydrocarbon
passing through the diaphragm and falls in a shower
on the substance contained in the vessel.</p>

<p>The hydrocarbon will trickle through the mass, taking
up whatever oily, resinous, or fatty matter it comes in contact
with until it falls through the lower diaphragm into
the space <i>D</i>, whence it may be drawn off from time to time
through the outlet-pipe, <i>h</i>.</p>

<p>In extracting oily, fatty, or resinous matter from vegetable
or animal substances by hydrocarbons, it has been
the practice either to subject them to hydrocarbon vapors,
or to immerse or steep the substances in hydrocarbon until
the latter takes up the oily, fatty, or resinous matter.</p>

<p>The vapor plan is preferable in treating wet animal substances,
such as offal; but for dry vegetable or animal
matter—seeds, for instance, or the residuum resulting from
the rendering of tallow—we prefer the plan before described.</p>

<p>The flooding or steeping of animal or vegetable matter in
liquid hydrocarbon results in a mixture or emulsion of
gelatinous, albuminous, and fatty or oily matter, combined
with animal or vegetable tissues, the whole forming an
amalgamated mass; hence, whatever fatty or oily matter is
extracted is accompanied by more or less of the suspended
gelatine or albumen, either of which is more difficult to remove
from the oil or fat, and has a tendency to discolor the
same.</p>

<p>This difficulty, it has been found, can be obviated by preventing
the hydrocarbon from remaining in a quiescent
state in contact with the material; in other words, by
causing it to trickle through the mass, which, by this plan,
retains its granular condition, and gives out its oil or fat to
the hydrocarbon without the albuminous or gelatinous
matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p>In the apparatus before described, for instance, an occurrence
of the objectionable flooding of the material, tending
to bring about the results previously mentioned, is obviated
by never permitting the extract in the lower portion of the
vessel <i>A</i> to reach the lower diaphragm <i>b</i>. By drawing off
the extract from time to time, any impediment to the free
discharge of the hydrocarbon with such oily and resinous
matter as it has taken up, through the lower diaphragm, is
prevented, and a continuous dripping of the hydrocarbon
through the mass secured.</p>

<p>The extract obtained by the trickling or filtering process
is much more concentrated than that obtained by the steeping
and flooding process.</p>

<p><i>Adamson’s Method for Treating Substances with Hydrocarbon
Vapor for the Purpose of Extracting Oils, Fats, etc.</i> This
improvement is intended to prevent the fetid or other odors
imparted to the vapor from the substances treated from
being recommunicated to the said substances, and to the
extracts obtained therefrom through the medium of the
vapor from the re-used hydrocarbon. The vapor is obtained
from benzine, benzole, etc.</p>

<p>Fig. 33 represents, partly in section, the apparatus
whereby the invention may be carried into effect.</p>

<p><i>A</i> is a vessel in which the substances have to be treated
by hydrocarbon vapor, the said substances being introduced
into the vessel through a manhole, <i>x</i>, and deposited
on a perforated diaphragm, <i>B</i>, the manhole being provided
with a suitable cover. A steam-coil, <i>D</i>, is placed in the
vessel in a space beneath the diaphragm, and liquid hydrocarbon
is introduced into the said space, and is there
vaporized by the steam-coil. The vapor rising through the
perforated diaphragm permeates the substance upon the
same, so as to extract therefrom the oily, fatty, or resinous
matter, which passes downward through the diaphragm
into the space below the same, whence it may be drawn off
from time to time through the discharge-pipe <i>j</i>. Liquid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
hydrocarbon may be introduced from a tank, or from a
source explained hereafter, into the top of the vessel <i>A</i>, so
that it will pass through the material and be vaporized
when it reaches the coil; the said material being in this
case subjected to a downward current of liquid hydrocarbon
and an upward current of vapor.</p>

<p>Previous to this invention it was Mr. Adamson’s practice
to cause the vapor, after acting upon the substances in the
vessel, to pass through a worm in a condenser, the lower
end of the worm communicating with the vessel, <i>A</i>, beneath
the diaphragm, as shown in Fig. 35, p. 85, so that
the hydrocarbon was used over and over again. But in
practice this has been found objectionable in many cases
for the following reason:—</p>

<p>In treating animal offal, for instance, for the extraction
of fats, fetid odors are imparted to the hydrocarbon vapor,
and remain, to a considerable extent, in the condensed
vapor when the latter is restored to the vessel <i>A</i>; hence, the
fetid odors were recommunicated both to the fatty extracts
and to the material. The same objections have been experienced
in treating meat for preservation and vegetable
matter for the extraction of oil by hydrocarbon vapor.</p>

<p>This difficulty is obviated in the following manner: The
vapor-pipe <i>D´</i> communicates with a vessel <i>H</i> at the top of
the same, and the vapor is met by numerous small jets of
cold water—in the present instance, from a perforated
tubular ring, <i>m</i>, into which the water is forced through a
pipe <i>n</i>.</p>

<p>Many different appliances may be used, such as roses,
revolving jets, etc., for causing a spray through which the
vapor must pass, and by which it must be condensed. The
result of this will be a supply, <i>I</i>, of tainted water on the
bottom of the vessel, <i>H</i>, and a quantity, <i>J</i>, of washed and
purified hydrocarbon above the water, the latter having
taken up the fetid odors.</p>

<p>The washed hydrocarbon may be drawn off through a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
pipe, <i>g</i>, into any suitable vessel, and thence introduced
through the pipe <i>h</i> into the vessel <i>A</i>, or may pass directly
into the latter to be again vaporized therein, the vapor after
permeating the material and passing through the pipe <i>D´</i>
being simultaneously condensed and washed in the vessel
<i>H</i>, preparatory to being returned in the condition of purified
liquid hydrocarbon to the vessel <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>By the practice of this process, the inventor is enabled to
obtain a purer extract than heretofore, and, at the same
time, the substances acted upon are more free from noxious
odors.</p>

<p>Changes may be made in the apparatus shown in Fig.
33, as, for instance, the vessel <i>A</i> may consist of a horizontal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
hollow cylinder, and the vaporizing of the hydrocarbon
may be accomplished otherwise than by a steam-coil.</p>

<p><i>Adamson’s Method for Treating Substances with Liquid Hydrocarbon
for the Purpose of Extracting Oils, Fats, etc.</i> This
invention relates to a method of treating animal and vegetable
substances with liquid hydrocarbons, such as benzene,
benzole, etc., for the purpose of extracting from such substances
oils, fats, etc.</p>

<p>The object of this improvement is to prevent the fetid
and other odors imparted to the liquid hydrocarbon by the
substances treated from being recommunicated to the substances
and to the extracts therefrom by the liquid hydrocarbon
when re-used.</p>

<p>In Fig. 34, there is shown a sectional view of apparatus
whereby this invention may be carried into effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p><i>A</i> is a vessel into which the substances to be treated are
introduced through a manhole, <i>x</i>, provided with a suitable
detachable cover, and through an opening in the upper
perforated diaphragm, <i>B</i>, a detachable perforated plate, <i>b</i>,
being placed over the opening after the substances have
been passed through the same, the substances being supported
by the lower perforated diaphragm, <i>B´</i>, beneath
which is a space for receiving the extract and liquid hydrocarbon
after the latter has percolated through the mass in
the vessel. The extract, which occupies the lowest position
in the vessel, may be removed therefrom from time to time
prior to being purified by distillation or otherwise. The
liquid hydrocarbon is permitted to pass from time to time
through a pipe, <i>d</i>, into a vessel, <i>D</i>, where it is met by jets
of water from a pipe, <i>f</i>, the hydrocarbon and water being
thoroughly agitated in the vessel by a revolving paddle-wheel,
<i>E</i>. This washing of the liquid hydrocarbon may
be accomplished by different appliances. For instance, the
paddle-wheel may be dispensed with, and water forced upward
into the vessel from below in the form of numerous
small jets. The water and hydrocarbon after this washing
operation are permitted to pass into the subsiding-vessel,
<i>H</i>, the hydrocarbon being above and the water below, the
fetid and other odors divided by the hydrocarbon from the
substances in the vessel, <i>A</i>, having, during the washing
operation, been transferred to the water, which may be
drawn off from time to time.</p>

<p>The washed and purified hydrocarbon may be pumped
directly through a pipe, <i>m</i>, into the vessel, <i>A</i>, to be re-used
for treating the substances therein; or it may be pumped,
first, into a reservoir, and permitted to flow from the same
into the said vessel, <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>More or less hydrocarbon is wasted by being drawn off
with the extract, and to make up for this loss a supply may
be introduced at intervals from a tank through the pipe, <i>h</i>.</p>

<p>By the practice of the process described above, the in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>ventor
is enabled to obtain a purer extract than by the
ordinary process of treating substances with liquid hydrocarbon.
At the same time the substances treated will be
much more free from noxious odors than when the hydrocarbon
is used over and over again without washing.</p>

<p>It is not essential strictly to adhere to the apparatus
shown in Fig. 34, as the construction of the apparatus will,
in fact, depend in a great measure on the locality in which
it is to be situated.</p>

<p><i>Adamson’s Process for Removing Hydrocarbons from Substances
which have been treated therewith.</i> This process consists
of washing from animal and vegetable substances the
hydrocarbon which they retain after being treated therewith
for the extraction of oils, fats, etc., and for other purposes.</p>

<p>Different apparatus may be employed for carrying out
this process, and it may be conducted in the same vessel in
which the material is treated with hydrocarbon.</p>

<p>The vessel, which is shown in Fig. 35, has been found to
answer well for this purpose.</p>

<p>This vessel is furnished with a suitable detachable cover,
<i>a</i>, and with two perforated or wire-gauze diaphragms, <i>b</i> and
<i>d</i>, both extending across the interior of the vessel, one near
the top and the other near the bottom of the same.</p>

<p>A steam-coil, <i>B</i>, communicating with any adjacent steam-generator,
is contained in the vessel below the lower diaphragm,
to vaporize the hydrocarbon, the vapor passing
through the substance between the two diaphragms and out
through a pipe, <i>D</i>, which passes through a condenser, <i>E</i>,
the latter restoring the hydrocarbon to a liquid form, in
which it is reconveyed to the vessel through a pipe, <i>D´</i>.</p>

<p>In practicing the washing process a pipe, <i>m</i>, to introduce
water into the vessel, and one or more outlet-pipes, <i>n n′</i>,
two in the present instance, are necessary. There may also
be a pipe, <i>p</i>, through which air can be introduced into the
vessel, under the circumstances explained hereafter.</p>

<p>When the treatment of the material in the vessel with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
hydrocarbon vapor or liquid hydrocarbon has been completed,
steam is cut off from the coil <i>B</i>, the pipes <i>D</i> and <i>D´</i>
are closed, and the cover <i>a</i> may be removed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 35.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p085.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Water is now admitted through the pipe <i>m</i> to the space
in the vessel below the diaphragm <i>d</i>, and the cocks of the
outlet-pipes <i>n n′</i> are opened.</p>

<p>The water permeates the material, passes upward through
the same, and carries with it the hydrocarbon, the latter
having a tendency to rise with the water.</p>

<p>As the water, and whatever hydrocarbon accompanies it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
pass through the upper diaphragm, <i>b</i>, the hydrocarbon will
at once rise to the surface, and will pass through the upper
outlet-pipe, <i>n</i>, into any suitable receptacle, the water passing
off through the lower outlet-pipe.</p>

<p>If this mode of separating the hydrocarbon from the
water is practiced, the admission of water to the vessel
should be such in respect to the outflow that the liquid will
remain at or near a uniform level, that is, the surface of the
liquid should bear the relation shown in the drawing to the
upper outlet.</p>

<p>The water and hydrocarbon, however, may be drawn off
indiscriminately into a suitable receptacle, and then separated
by decantation; but it is advisable in all cases that the
water should extend above the mass of material in the vessel,
so that the hydrocarbon can at once rise to the surface
as it escapes from the substance.</p>

<p>When the material is of such a character as to be closely
packed and not easily displaced by the upwardly-flowing
water (and this is especially the case with seeds which have
been treated with hydrocarbons), it is necessary to agitate
the mass, so that the water can gain access to every part
thereof. This agitation the inventor prefers to effect by air
under pressure introduced through a pipe, <i>p</i>, although
mechanical appliances may be used for the purpose.</p>

<p>It will be understood that the process may be conducted
in a vessel separate from which the substances have been
treated with hydrocarbon. A vessel similar to that shown,
for instance, but without the coil and pipes, <i>D D´</i>, may be
used, and may be furnished with trunnions (shown by
dotted lines) and adapted to bearings, so as to be easily
tilted when its contents have to be removed; or the vessel
may have an opening near the lower diaphragm for the
withdrawal of its contents, a suitable detachable door being
adapted to the opening.</p>

<p><i>F. Seltsam’s apparatus.</i> In this process the solvent is
boiled with the bones, previously coarsely crushed and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
dust sifted out, in a strong closed vessel, so as to obtain a
higher temperature, greater penetration and avoidance of
loss. The vapor ascending condenses in the pores, extracts
the fat and collects under the false bottom as a layer of
solution which is subsequently distilled. The apparatus is
shown in Fig. 36. The cylinder, <i>A</i>, is capable of withstanding
a pressure of 10 atmospheres, and serves for the
generation of steam and as an extracting vessel. It is filled
with bones and hermetically closed. The required quantity
of solvent is then brought by means of the pump, <i>B</i>,
from the reservoir, <i>C</i>, through the pipe, <i>D</i>, into the cylinder,
<i>A</i>, and the latter is heated. The vapors formed force
the air through the pipe, <i>E</i>, into the condenser, <i>F</i>, where
any vapor which may be carried along is condensed and
passes through the pipe, <i>G</i>, back into the reservoir, <i>C</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p087.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When all the air has been expelled from the apparatus
and the pores of the bones, the cock on the pipe, <i>E</i>, is
closed. The cylinder, <i>A</i>, is then heated so that a pressure
of a few atmospheres prevails in it. The vapors now act
energetically upon the bones, the dissolved fat collecting
upon the cylinder; the cock on the pipe, <i>H</i>, is then opened,
and the superheated fluid discharged under high pressure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
into the distilling apparatus, <i>J</i>, and the solvent is distilled
off from the fat by means of steam. The vapors of the
solvent pass through the pipe, <i>K</i>, into the condenser, <i>F</i>,
and from there back into the reservoir, <i>C</i>.</p>

<p>When the manometer on <i>A</i> indicates no pressure, the
cock on the pipe, <i>H</i>, is closed and the cylinder, <i>A</i>, again
heated, the pipe, <i>E</i>, being open, so that any solvent still
adhering to the bones may escape to the condenser, <i>F</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 37.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p088.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Figs. 37 and 38 illustrate Seltsam’s apparatus as improved
by Th. Richter, whereby the operation becomes
entirely free from danger, the vaporization of the solvent
being effected by steam only, and the work is carried on
continuously.</p>

<p>There are two extracting vessels, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, of thick
boiler-plate, and provided with false bottoms, <i>G</i>, upon
which the bones are placed, steam being admitted into the
space between the true and false bottoms. The extracting
vessels are surrounded by the jackets, <i>C</i>, and are further
provided with the vacuum gauges, <i>E</i>, and the air-cocks, <i>F</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

<p>There are, in addition, two other vessels, <i>H</i> and <i>J</i>, which
contain water, a vessel, <i>K</i>, for the solvent, and an air-pump,
<i>L</i>. The operation is carried on as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 38.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p089.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The extracting vessels, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, are charged with bones,
all the cocks, with the exception of <i>M</i> and <i>N</i> closed, and
the air-pump, <i>L</i>, is set in motion, whereby a vacuum is
formed in <i>A</i>. When this is sufficiently large, water is admitted
from <i>H</i> through the cock <i>O</i> into the space <i>P</i>. The
water-cock is then closed and the steam-cock, <i>Q</i>, opened.
The steam entering the space, <i>R</i>, brings the water in <i>P</i> to
the boiling-point, and the air-pump sucks off the steam
formed after the cock, <i>N</i>, is opened. The air-pump is then
stopped and all the cocks closed, except <i>S</i>. The solvent
now passes from the vessel, <i>K</i>, into the space <i>P</i>, and after
closing the cock <i>S</i>, is evaporated by the admission of steam
into <i>R</i>. The water-cock is then opened and cold water admitted
into the jacket <i>C</i>, the solvent saturated with fat
being thereby condensed in <i>P</i>. The water is then discharged
from <i>C</i> and steam introduced into <i>R<sub>1</sub></i>, whereby the
solvent is evaporated and forced into the extracting vessel
<i>B</i> by means of the air-pump, <i>L</i>, after closing the cocks <i>M</i>
and <i>V</i>.</p>

<p>The process is then repeated in <i>B</i>, after a vacuum has
been created in the same manner as in <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the vacuum in <i>A</i> is interrupted by
opening the air-cock <i>F</i> and the fat drawn off through <i>P</i> by
opening the cock <i>U</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p>The bones freed from fat are removed through the manhole
<i>D</i>, and <i>A</i> is charged with fresh material while the
operation is carried on in <i>B</i>. Thus the operation is continuous,
the solvent passing without any loss whatever from
one extracting vessel to the other.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 39.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p090.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Alfred Leuner’s apparatus. Fig. 39, works on the Soxhlet
principle, without pressure, using solvent and steam simultaneously.
The bones are placed in <i>A</i> above the perforated
false bottom <i>B</i>. <i>D</i> is a steampipe by means of which the
bones are steamed as a preliminary, the surplus steam es<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>caping
through the outlet pipe <i>E</i>. After steaming, water
and benzine are run in from the reservoir <i>F</i>, into the space
under the false bottom, and heated by the steam coil <i>P</i>.
The vapors evolved are condensed in the worm <i>K</i>, and at
first run back over the bones through the cock <i>L</i>, the vapor
passing upwards to the worm through <i>R</i>, and the condensed
liquid being divided into separate streams by the spreading
plate <i>O</i>. After some time the cock <i>G</i> is opened so that the
condensed liquid runs into the reservoir <i>F</i>, instead of flowing
back into <i>A</i>. When all the solvent has volatilized
nothing but water condenses in the worm, which is known
by means of a sampling cock attached to <i>A</i>, the draw-off
cock <i>E</i> is then opened and the watery gelatinous solution
and oily matter run off into a suitable separating receptacle.
The bones in <i>A</i> are then discharged through a manhole,
and <i>A</i> being refilled, the whole operation is repeated.</p>

<p><i>Extraction with hydrochloric acid.</i> If the bones are to be
chiefly worked for glue, extraction with hydrochloric acid,
which has been referred to in Chapter III, under “Bones
and Cartilages” may be highly recommended, the bones
being thereby freed from their mineral constituents and the
glue-yielding substance remaining behind in a pure state.
The bones are allowed to remain in contact with the acid
till they are flexible and translucent. This may be readily
recognized by laying upon the material in the vat a bone
split in two. When the latter by the treatment with acid
shows the characteristic appearance of swollen cartilage,
<i>i. e.</i>, has become translucent, extraction may be considered
complete.</p>

<p>The solution is then drawn off through a tap immediately
above the bottom of the vat into stoneware vessels,
and conveyed to the evaporating pans. The tap is then
closed and enough water to cover the cartilage is admitted
into the vat, and the whole allowed to stand for a few
hours in order to extract as much as possible the solution
of bone-salts remaining in the cartilage. The fluid is then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
drawn off. It is a quite concentrated solution of bone-salts
and, mixed with an equal volume of hydrochloric acid,
may be used for the extraction of fresh quantities of bones,
or be mixed with the fluid first drawn off and evaporated.</p>

<p>The further washing of the cartilage is effected by repeatedly
pouring water over it, the operation being continued
until the water running off shows no acid reaction.
Washing has to be done very carefully, since glue-solution
obtained from cartilage containing but a very small quantity
of acid will not congeal. It is, therefore, advisable to
add to the last wash-water 1 per cent. of soda, this quantity
being quite sufficient for the neutralization of the last traces
of acid.</p>

<p><i>Sulphurous acid process.</i> In this country sulphurous acid
is largely employed in the manufacture of glue derived
from bones. When ordinary bones are treated with a current
of moist sulphurous acid gas, they absorb from 10 to
12 per cent. of their weight of the gas in the course of 12
hours. The amount may increase to 15 or 20 per cent. on
longer treatment, but the excess will then disappear on
exposure to air. Messrs. Grillo and Schroeder of Düsseldorf,
who patented this process in 1894, believe that this is
simply due to the calcium phosphate present in the bones,
and remark that an absorption of 11 to 12 per cent. on the
gross weight amounts to 16 or 17 per cent. of the inorganic
constituents, and corresponds to the equation:</p>

<p>
Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + SO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = 2CaHPO<sub>4</sub> + CaSO<sub>3</sub>,<br />
</p>

<p>the sulphurous acid simply acting in the same way as sulphuric
acid does in the manufacture of superphosphate, but
being a milder acid than sulphuric, the alteration of the
organic constituents which are available for glue-stock can
be almost entirely avoided. The acid phosphate is soluble
in water, therefore the bones after treatment are easily disintegrated
by boiling water when a large portion of the
lime remains in the sediment, while the gelatine is dissolved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p>The process as commercially conducted is very similar to
the well-known sulphite method of treating paper pulp, and
is carried on in iron cylinders or better in close wooden vats
lined with lead.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 40.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p093.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The gas is usually generated in an impure form, with a
large admixture of air and carbonic acid, by combustion of
pyrites and coal, of crude sulphur, or even of only highly
pyritous fuel.</p>

<p>On the other hand, since it is well established that the
absorption of a diluted gas is less ready, and is more wasteful
than that of a gas in a pure state, the employment of a
definite quantity of sulphur dioxide in a concentrated state,
either prepared by the regulated burning of sulphur, or the
decomposition of sulphuric acid, yields more regular results,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
and a product of better quality. Liquid sulphur dioxide,
which is now obtainable at a moderate price and in quantity,
has the advantage that it yields a continuous current
of pure gas of any required rapidity by simply opening a
valve, and that the exact amount used can be ascertained
by taring the containing vessel before and after the operation
(S. Rideall).</p>

<p>The washed bones are brought into the above-mentioned
cylinder or vat and treated with a saturated solution of sulphurous
acid. The duration of the action of the acid varies
according to the condition of the material and can only be
determined by experience. The result of the process is a
liquor almost as clear as water, which, after evaporation in
the vacuum pan, is equal as regards clearness and lustre, to
the best quality of glue prepared from waste of hide and
skin. The fat extracted from the bleached bones is lighter
in color and has not the disagreeable odor of ordinary bone
fat, and consequently brings a better price.</p>

<p>For the generation of sulphurous acid Dr. Bruno Terne,
of Mass., has constructed a very simple apparatus shown in
Fig. 40. The sulphur is burned in <i>S</i>; <i>A</i> is the escape pipe
of stone; <i>T</i>, the collecting reservoir; <i>P</i>, the steam-pump
for acid; <i>R</i>, chimney for the sulphur burner.</p>


<h4>4. CONVERSION OF CARTILAGE INTO GLUE.</h4>

<p>The conversion into glue of the swollen cartilage obtained
by treatment with hydrochloric or sulphurous acid
may be effected by continued boiling in open pans or in an
apparatus recommended by Wm. Friedberg, and shown in
Fig. 41.</p>

<p>The boiler <i>K</i> of thick boiler-plate has a diameter equal to
its height. Underneath the perforated false bottom <i>S</i>, which
serves for the support of the bones, lies a perforated steam
coil <i>R—D</i> for the introduction of steam. To this steam
coil is fitted a branch-pipe <i>d</i>, which reaches into the upper
portion of the boiler into which also enters the water-pipe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
<i>W</i>. The apparatus is further fitted with a water-gauge, an
air cock, sampling cock and manhole for the introduction
of the cartilage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p095.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The mode of operation with this apparatus is as follows:
The boiler is filled three-quarters full with cartilage.
Enough water to fill the boiler one-quarter full is then admitted
through the pipe <i>W</i>, and the steam-cock <i>D</i> opened.
The steam passing out through the numerous perforations
in the coil <i>R</i>, is at first condensed in the water, but soon
brings the latter to the boiling-point, and from this stage on
begins the formation of glue. The glue dissolves in the
water, and a sample of the solution is from time to time
drawn off through the sampling cock and tested as to its
concentration. When the solution possesses the required
concentration, the admission of steam through <i>R</i> is interrupted,
and the cock <i>d</i> of the branch-pipe opened, as well
as the cock of the discharge pipe <i>H</i>, the latter being opened
gradually. The discharge pipe <i>H</i> is connected with the
perforated plate <i>F</i>, which is covered with a closely-woven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
cloth and thus acts as a filter, retaining all the solid particles
suspended in the glue solution.</p>

<p>By opening the cock <i>d</i> of the branch-pipe, the steam-pressure
acts only upon the surface of the fluid, the latter
being consequently pressed with great force through the
filter-cloth.</p>

<p>When the hissing noise caused by escaping steam indicates
that all the fluid has been removed from the boiler,
the cock <i>d</i> of the branch-pipe is closed, and through a rose
fitted above the boiler, water is allowed to flow upon the
latter. By this cooling the greater portion of the steam in
the boiler is condensed and water may be admitted
through <i>W</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p096.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The operation of glue-boiling is then commenced anew
by admitting steam into the steam coil, and continued
until the cartilaginous mass has been reduced to about one-third
of its original bulk, when the apparatus is opened,
fresh material introduced, and the whole operation repeated.</p>

<p>In order to be able to replace the filter without having
to empty the entire apparatus, it has been given the shape
shown in Fig. 42. The upper portion of the discharge-pipe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
<i>A</i> is connected with the lower portion by the box-screw <i>H</i>.
In the latter is inserted a short cylinder, <i>C</i>, with a perforated
bottom upon which is placed the filter-cloth; the
latter is kept in position by the ring <i>R</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 43.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p097.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>For every apparatus two of the above-described filters
will be required. If, notwithstanding a full steam pressure,
the glue solution runs off sluggishly, it is indicative of the
pores of the filter being choked up. The screw-box <i>H</i> is
then removed, the filter taken out and replaced by another
one.</p>

<p>The glue solution discharged from the apparatus is in
most cases sufficiently clear to allow of its being immediately
evaporated. However, for the production of a particularly
fine quality of glue, it is advisable to clarify the
solution by settling. As the liquor has to be kept warm to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
allow of the solid particles to settle, W. Friedberg recommends
the use of the apparatus shown in Fig. 43. It consists
of an iron cylinder with a diameter equal to one-third
of its height. The front of the cylinder is furnished with a
number of cocks placed at equal distances from each other,
and also with a pipe in the slightly conical bottom. It is
surrounded by a wooden jacket, the intermediate space
being filled with a bad conductor of heat. By this arrangement
the liquor is kept warm and in a liquid state for
several hours, giving ample time for the solid bodies held
in suspension to settle on the bottom. The condition of
the liquor is from time to time tested by allowing a small
quantity of it to run into a glass from the lowest cock in
front. If the sample is perfectly clear, the liquor may be
drawn off. If, however, after several hours’ standing only
the upper portions of the liquor are clear, while the lower
ones are still turbid, further clarification by this means is
impossible. The upper portions of the liquor are then used
for finer qualities of glue and the lower ones for inferior
grades.</p>

<p>By treating the cartilage with high-pressure steam, a
liquor is obtained which on cooling congeals to quite a
solid jelly, and it might be immediately brought into the
forming-boxes, cut into cakes, and dried. However, as the
drying of the glue is one of the most difficult operations for
the glue-maker, it is of great advantage to obtain the liquor
in as high a state of concentration as possible in order to
obtain a solid jelly, which causes the least difficulty in drying.
For this purpose the liquors leaving the clarifying
vat with a strength of about 20 per cent. dry glue are
evaporated down to a strength of about 32 per cent. in
winter, and 35 per cent. in summer. Evaporation may be
effected in open pans or in vacuum.</p>

<p>Fig. 44 shows the arrangement of an open evaporating
pan. The copper pan <i>P</i> has the form of a shallow cylinder
with a slightly conical bottom, in the lowest point of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
is the discharge pipe for the concentrated liquor. During
the operation the discharge pipe is closed by the ball-valve
<i>V</i>, which can be raised by the lever contrivance <i>M</i>. The
pan is surrounded by an iron steam-jacket; the steam
passes in at <i>D</i>, and the condensed water runs off at <i>A</i>. <i>H</i>
is a sampling cock for taking samples to test the concentration
of the liquor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p099.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>To prevent the workroom from being filled with steam
arising from the pan, the latter is covered with a hood of
wood which terminates in the pipe <i>S</i> projecting above the
roof, and a narrow pipe <i>R</i> branching off from the steam
pipe <i>D</i> passes into <i>S</i>.</p>

<p>When vapors commence to arise from the liquor, the
cock on the pipe <i>R</i> is slightly opened whereby a jet of steam
is blown into the pipe <i>S</i>, the latter then acting as an exhauster,
and the vapors in the hood <i>C</i> are carried along by
the jet of steam. By this arrangement no vapor passes into
the workroom and steam is also very rapidly evolved from
the surface of the liquor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p>Sufficient steam should be admitted to the pan for the
liquor to give out an abundance of vapor without, however,
being brought to the boiling-point, as in that case foam
would be formed and the liquor in cooling yield a product
full of blisters. When the liquor has acquired the proper
degree of concentration, the admission of steam to <i>D</i> and <i>R</i>
is interrupted and the valve <i>V</i> having been raised the liquor
is run into the cooling-boxes. The latter are of wood lined
with zinc, or better of stout zinc or heavily galvanized iron.
They hold about ½ cwt. and are of two shapes: one deep
and nearly square, another long and shallow, for quick
cooling of clear liquors. Iron should not be used, as it
readily rusts and causes discoloration of the glue.</p>

<p>Cooling is effected by cold water where it is available,
but often merely by cold air, aided by fans or blowers, in a
room protected from heat or frost. According to S. Rideal,
refrigerating machines are now also employed, which, by
the evaporation of liquid gases, such as ammonia, sulphurous
or carbonic acid, reduce a tank of brine to near freezing-point.
The temperature should not be allowed below 33°
or 34° F., for if frozen the jelly is hard and difficult to cut.
The brine circulates in iron pipes placed near the ceiling of
the room; they must be kept as clear as possible of ice and
dirt, and the cooling house should be scrupulously clean
and sweet.</p>

<p>Spiral evaporators are recommended by Thomas Lambert
as forming a ready and economical means of evaporation.
The evaporator consists of a spiral steam coil, made
of copper, and 2 inches in diameter, revolving on a centre
shaft; the lower half of the coil is covered with the glue-liquor
in the trough. The shaft rests on two plummer-blocks,
one receiving the steam, and the other discharging
the spent steam and condensed water. The shaft is hollow
to the first coil, and the steam is thus conveyed to the
spiral. From the last coil to the end of the plummer-block
the shaft is also hollow, and in that portion resting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
on the block two openings are made. In the inside of the
plummer-block, two openings are bored to the outside, each
forming a covered channel; as the shaft revolves, all the
holes directly face each other at intervals, and thus allow
any condensed water in the coils to be blown through.
From 25 to 28 coils are generally used in each spiral. The
glue-liquors are fed into the trough at one end, and have a
temperature of 75° F.; the temperature of the evaporated
liquor is 85° F. In the rather slow passage through the
trough, the liquors receiving the heat of the revolving coils
are raised in strength from 20 per cent. to 32 per cent. dry
glue, at which point they are ready for jellying.</p>

<p><i>Vacuum pans</i> are much used in this country for evaporating
glue-liquors, though there are some complaints made of
the great waste owing to spray and froth being carried off
in the steam. As is well known the boiling-point is
lowered by increasing the pressure on the surface of a fluid.
By enclosing water in a vessel connected with a constantly
working air-pump, it is brought to the boiling-point by
heating to between 95° and 104° F. The construction of
vacuum pans is based upon this principle, and such
apparatus is largely used in many manufacturing processes
for evaporating to a certain degree fluids, for instance, sugar
solutions, which readily become decomposed at a higher
temperature. Vacuum pans are also very suitable for the
evaporation of glue-solution, especially in plants working
on a large scale.</p>

<p>Fig. 45 represents an elevation of a vacuum pan for evaporating
glue and gelatine liquors as described by Thomas
Lambert. The pan is built of steel plates, and lined outside
with wood work, and rests on a floor constructed of
rolled steel plates, supported on four columns, with a stairway
leading to the working platform. One half of the
lower part is shown in section, giving a view of the coils by
which the pan is heated. The various parts are as follows:
<i>A</i>, the body of the pan; <i>B</i>, the dome; <i>C</i>, exhaust pipe lead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>ing
from the dome to the condenser; <i>D</i>, condenser; <i>E</i>, air
or vacuum pump; <i>F</i>, storage tank for glue or gelatine
liquors, warmed with steam coil; <i>G</i>, supply pipe leading
from storage tank to vacuum pan; <i>H</i>, discharge valve; <i>I</i>,
barometer gauge for indicating vacuum; <i>J</i>, inlet steam pipe
for supplying the coils; <i>K</i>, exhaust end of vacuum coils;
<i>L</i>, iron staircase; <i>M</i>, steel floor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 45.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p102.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The accessories to the pan are placed in a convenient
position above the working floor and include a steam gauge
for noting the pressure in the coils, a gauge for indicating
the height of the liquor in the pan, vacuum gauge <i>I</i>, as
shown in the drawing, air-cocks and a thermometer. The
pan is also fitted with a small apparatus, by which portions
of the boiling liquor can from time to time be drawn, without
disarranging the vacuum, so that the progress of evaporation
can be ascertained.</p>

<p>In working the pan, the storage tank <i>F</i> is first filled with
the weak glue liquors to be evaporated; the valve on the
supply pipe <i>G</i> is then closed, and the vacuum pump set in
motion; a few strokes are sufficient to reduce the internal
pressure, and the valve of the supply pipe is then opened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
and the liquor allowed to fill up the pan to the desired
mark on the gauge. The valve is then closed, the steam-inlet
valve <i>J</i>, supplying the coils, opened. As the heat
from the coils spreads through the liquor, the vacuum pump
is kept steadily at work reducing the inside pressure to
within 2 to 2½ inches of a perfect vacuum, as seen on the
barometrical scale. In this vacuum the liquor will boil at
120° to 130° F., and the boiling is continued until the withdrawn
samples, as tested by the glue-meter, show the desired
strength. The pump is then stopped, the vacuum broken
by opening the air-cocks, and the concentrated liquor is run
through the valve <i>H</i> into suitably arranged receiving tanks,
for supplying the trays or glasses for jellying.</p>

<p>For economical working with large quantities of weak
liquors, a combination of two, three and even four vacuum
pans, forming the double, triple and quadruple effect evaporators,
have been designed for concentration purposes.
The triple effect is, however, the system mostly in use, and
consists of a grouping of three cylindrical pans, each connected
by suitably arranged piping, by which the vapors of
the first pan are conveyed to and made to heat the coils of
a second pan, the resulting vapors from the second, passing
on to the third pan, for a similar purpose. All the pans
are connected with powerful pumps, producing a nearly
absolute vacuum in each. The liquor is evaporated to a
given density in the first pan, and then passed on to the
second, and ultimately to the third, at which stage 80 per
cent. of its water will have been driven off.</p>

<p>To obtain in all cases a product of equal concentration,
it is advisable to have an instrument which will indicate
the amount of dry glue in the solution. (Fig. 46.)</p>

<p>By immersing a glass aerometer in the glue-liquor, the
percentage of glue is indicated by a scale registering from
0 to 70 per cent. with the jelly or glue solution at a temperature
of 167° F.</p>

<p>To measure the temperature quickly, a thermometer is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
added, and for the execution of the entire test, a sheet-iron
vessel consisting of a large and two small tubes, <i>a</i>, which
when not in use, serve for the reception of the glass instruments
contained in a special case. For testing, the small
cylinder is placed in the large tube, <i>a</i>, and filled with jelly
by means of the cap which serves as a cover. The large
tube is filled with hot water to bring the jelly to the required
temperature. The two instruments are then
immersed in the tubes filled with glue-liquors to be tested,
and temperature as well as percentage can be readily
read off.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 46.</span></div>

<p>The evaporated and cooled glue-liquor is cut into cakes
and dried in the same manner as previously described.</p>


<h4>5. PROCESS FOR THE SIMULTANEOUS UTILIZATION OF BONES
FOR FAT, BONE-MEAL AND GLUE.</h4>

<p>Manufacturers frequently sort the bones in such a way
that materials of different quality are obtained. Thick,
compact bones are utilized for the manufacture of animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
charcoal, a comparatively small percentage of bone-meal
resulting in crushing such bones.</p>

<p>Incompact, porous bones, on the other hand, yield not
only crummy animal charcoal of less value, but in stamping
also a larger percentage of bone-meal than compact
bones. Hence they are as a rule directly worked for fat,
glue and steamed bone-meal, no attempt being made to
convert them into such granular pieces as are suitable for
the production of charcoal.</p>

<p>For this purpose, the bones are first broken by a crusher
or mill into coarse pieces, and the fat extracted by a special
process or together with the glue in one operation. The
latter method would seem to be the most suitable, time and
labor being thereby saved, but it must be borne in mind
that fat extracted by itself brings a much better price than
that obtained by steaming, and besides the yield of glue is
larger from steamed bones which have been previously
degreased.</p>

<p>The crushed bones—whether degreased or not—are subjected
to the action of high-pressure steam. The apparatus,
Fig. 47, used for this purpose consists of a cylinder of thick
boiler-plate, 10 to 13 feet high and 3 to 4 feet in diameter.
<i>E</i> and <i>A</i> are manholes, which can be closed steam-tight.
The pipe <i>D</i> leads to the steam-boiler and opposite to <i>D</i> is a
short pipe, <i>H</i>. The cylinder is further fitted with the perforated
false bottom, <i>S</i>, and the bent pipe, <i>L</i>.</p>

<p>As a rule, four to six, and in larger plants even more, of
such cylinders are combined to a battery. In this case the
discharge pipe, <i>L</i>, terminates in a common collecting vessel,
and the steam-pipes, <i>D</i>, branch off from a main steampipe.
The battery may be enclosed by brickwork, but is
preferably placed upon a suitable foundation and surrounded
by woodwork, the intermediate space between
woodwork and cylinders being filled with sawdust. This
plan offers the best means of keeping the heat together, and
the further advantage that, in case one of the cylinders be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>comes
defective, it can be readily taken out and replaced
by a new one.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p106.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In order to be able to fill the cylinders rapidly and with
the least expenditure of power, it is advisable to place the
bone-crusher at such a height that the crushed bones fall
directly into carriages which are run upon a small railway
over the charging holes of the cylinders, and emptied. In
front of the manholes, <i>A</i>, for discharging the bones is also a
railway, so that the crushed bones can be directly emptied
into carriages and conveyed to the stamping mill.</p>

<p>The cylinder having been filled with bones, is closed
steam-tight. The cock, <i>H</i>, is then opened and steam admitted
by opening the cock <i>D</i>. The steam passing in at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
first, is cooled off by coming in contact with the bones and
condensed to water. However, the temperature in the
cylinder soon becomes so high that the steam is no longer
condensed and, having first expelled the air in the cylinder
through the pipe <i>H</i>, it escapes through the latter in the form
of a powerful jet. When this is the case <i>H</i> is closed and
high-pressure steam allowed to act upon the bones.</p>

<p>The fat contained in the bones melts and trickles down.
On the bottom of the cylinder collects a fluid which contains
glue, is of a milky turbidity due to admixed drops of
fat, and with a quite thick layer of fat upon its surface.
From time to time—about every hour—the cock <i>L</i> is
slightly opened. By the pressure of the steam the glue-liquor
is expelled with great force through the pipe <i>L</i>, the
latter being closed when by the peculiar noise it is noticed
that only steam escapes.</p>

<p>Steaming and the occasional discharge of melted fat are
continued until on testing a sample of the liquor running
off, it is noticed to be free from fat. The liquor in the
cylinder is then expelled by the pressure of steam, the
steam-cock <i>D</i> closed, the manhole <i>A</i> opened, and steam
again admitted through <i>D</i>. By the steam-pressure the
greater portion of the bones in the cylinder is expelled
through the manhole <i>A</i>. The bones coming from the
cylinder are pliable and soft, and, after drying, are readily
converted by grinding into bone-meal.</p>

<p>For the manufacture of animal charcoal it is of the
utmost importance that steaming should be interrupted at
the time when the bones are completely degreased. If,
however, only fat, glue and bone-meal are to be produced,
steaming may advantageously be continued for a longer
time.</p>

<p>The longer the bones are subjected to the action of high-pressure
steam, the more complete the conversion of glue-yielding
substance into glue will be. To be sure, the bone-meal
obtained from such bones will contain somewhat less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
nitrogen than the product from bones not steamed quite so
long. However, the content of phosphates will in both
cases be the same, and on this depends, in the main, the
fertilizing value of bone-meal.</p>

<p>The fluid discharged from the cylinder consists of a mixture
of glue-liquor and drops of fat. It is run into a large
vat, in which it is kept warm for a few hours, when the fat
rises and collects in a coherent mass on the surface. The
fat is then drawn off through cocks in the upper portion of
the vat, while the glue-liquor is discharged from the bottom
of the vat, running first upon a very fine meshed sieve,
which retains the coarser bodies held in suspension, and
then directly into the evaporator. In the latter the liquor
is evaporated to the desired strength, when it is run into
the clarifying vats, and finally into the cooling vessels.</p>

<p>With the above-described process, the simultaneous
utilization of the bones for animal charcoal is only possible
if the crushed steamed bones are passed through a sieve for
the purpose of sorting out the granular pieces of suitable
size. However, in the process above described, incompact
bones are, as a rule, used which give but a small percentage
of granulated pieces, and the latter yield an inferior quality
of animal charcoal. It is therefore best to use the steamed
bones from which the fat and glue have been extracted for
the production of bone-meal.</p>

<p>For the manufacture of animal charcoal, the bones have
to be carefully sorted, fresh bones rich in organic substance
being best for the purpose, and the hardest and thickest
pieces should be selected. Previous to carbonization, the
bones are degreased by extraction with benzine or carbon
disulphide, and then crushed.</p>

<p>Carbonization was formerly effected in iron pots having
a capacity of about 25 quarts each. However, by this
process a uniform product of good quality cannot be obtained,
and, besides, the total quantity of organic substance
of the bones is lost. At present carbonization is effected in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
retorts, whereby large quantities of animal charcoal are in
a comparatively short time obtained, and, besides, the products
of destructive distillation can be completely utilized.
An essential product of distillation is a large quantity of
inflammable gases, which can be used for heating the
retort-furnace or for illuminating the entire plant, it being,
however, best to arrange the conduits so that the gases can
be used for either purpose.</p>

<p>A detailed discussion of the methods for gaining and
further working of the products of distillation is not within
the scope of this work, and only a brief description of a
plant for the manufacture of animal charcoal will here be
given.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 48.</div>
<img src="images/i_p109.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Figs. 48 and 49 show the arrangement of a Belgian
retort-furnace, Fig. 48 representing a vertical section
lengthways, and Fig. 49 a horizontal section. The illustrations,
however, are given at different heights in order to
show plainly the arrangement of the fire-place and the
passage of the fire-gases.</p>

<p>The cast-iron retorts—sixteen in the apparatus shown—are
placed in rows alongside and one after another, so as
to be swept as uniformly as possible by the fire. As will
be seen from Fig. 49 the firing is so arranged that only the
upper portions of the retorts are touched by the flames. <i>B</i>
is the actual fire-place, and <i>A</i> the ash-pit, both being fur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>nished
with closely fitting doors so that the fire may be
properly regulated, and the retorts eventually be exclusively
heated with gas.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 49.</div>
<img src="images/i_p110.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The retorts are cylindrical in form, with one end closed.
At the open end is fixed the frame or mouth-piece, which
carries the door swung on a hinge. The door has a slight
projecting rim, some two inches wide, which, with the surface
of the frame, is ground perfectly true; on closing, the
joint is made gas-tight by a lever arrangement.</p>

<p>The fire-gases escaping from <i>B</i> are distributed as uniformly
as possible by the flues, <i>a</i>, carried underneath the
pans, <i>E</i>, and finally pass out in the direction of the arrows
through a chimney.</p>

<p>At the time when the extraction of fat was exclusively
effected by boiling the bones, the pans <i>E</i> served for this
purpose, and the spaces <i>D</i>, <i>D</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>D</i><sub>2</sub>, etc., alongside the pans,
which were also heated by the fire-gases, were used for drying
the bones. However, at present, the extraction of fat
is, as a rule, effected by means of benzine or carbon disulphide,
and it is advisable to replace the pans, <i>E</i>, by a bone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>kiln,
and eventually to utilize any waste heat for heating
the evaporators for glue-liquor.</p>

<p>Fixed to the upper portion of each retort is a pipe, and
these pipes lead into a very wide iron-pipe, <i>T</i>. The products
of destructive distillation escaping from the retorts
combine in <i>T</i>, and besides having a very large diameter,
this pipe must be considerably inclined to avoid the
accumulation of products of distillation in it. To prevent
the products of distillation from depositing in a crystalline
form in <i>T</i>, the latter is covered with a bad conductor of
heat.</p>

<p>The pipe <i>T</i> is connected with a series of condensing
vessels, <i>D</i>, another series of vessels being placed alongside
the first one, so that the vapors may be conducted, as
desired, into either one of them. Two batteries of such
condensing vessels are required, as one of them has from
time to time to be disengaged in order to be cleansed.</p>

<p>If the products of distillation would have to overcome
the entire pressure of the column of fluid in the condensing
vessels, their escape from the retorts would be very much
retarded. To avoid this, plates are arranged horizontally a
few inches below the level of the fluid, and the pipes dip
into the condensing vessels only far enough to permit the
escaping vapors to pass under these plates. By this arrangement,
the vapors sweep under the plates and are
absorbed by the fluids, a strong pressure in the apparatus
being thus avoided.</p>

<p>The condensing batteries may of course consist of any
number of vessels, but as a rule only a sufficient number to
retain all the ammonia is employed, five being in most
cases sufficient for this purpose. The last condenser is connected
with an exhaust-pump, <i>p p</i>, which is kept in motion
by a motor, <i>P</i>.</p>

<p>The pump removes all the bodies remaining in the last
condenser and forces them, according to the position of the
cock back of the pump, either into a glass-bell or through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
the pipe <i>H</i> and the nozzles <i>a</i> into the fire-place where they
are burned.</p>

<p>To obtain the various products of distillation, the condensing
vessels have to be filled with acid, and should
therefore be constructed of lead or at least of sheet-iron
lined with lead. The products to be obtained depend on
the fluid used for filling the vessels; if filled with dilute
sulphuric acid, ammonium sulphate is obtained, which may
be utilized in the preparation of fertilizers. If hydrochloric
acid is employed for the absorption of ammonia, solution of
ammonium chloride is obtained, which may be crystallized
by evaporation.</p>

<p>The products evolved in the destructive distillation of
bones consist of various hydrocarbons and appear either as
badly-smelling brown liquors—bone-tar—or as illuminating
gas. The vapors contain further considerable quantities of
ammonium carbonate and cyanide of ammonium. To obtain
the latter, the last condensing vessel is filled with green
vitriol solution, the cyanogen compounds remaining behind
in the solution. If the gas escaping from the last condenser
is to be used for illuminating purposes, it is freed from the
greater portion of carbonic acid contained in it by purification
with lime.</p>

<p>The mode of operation with Belgian retort furnaces is as
follows: The retorts having been filled with comminuted
degreased bones, the doors are closed perfectly gas-tight and
firing is commenced. The pump is set in motion until a
jet of gas blows through the nozzles. When this gas-jet
burns with a luminous flame, destructive distillation of the
bones is in full blast. The pump is then run with such
velocity that the pressure in the interior of the retorts, as
indicated by the manometer, is slightly greater than the
external air-pressure, and the operation is thus continued
so long as inflammable gases escape from the pipe <i>H</i>. The
pump is then stopped, and one-half of the charcoal contained
in the retorts is withdrawn to the canisters placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
ready to receive it. The lids of the canisters are then luted
down with a paste of char-dust and water, making an air-tight
joint, and the charcoal is allowed to cool.</p>

<p>The retorts having been partially emptied, are at once
refilled to the brim with crushed bones and closed gas-tight.
There is but little or no loss of heat between withdrawing
and charging, and distillation of the freshly-introduced
bones commences immediately after charging, and is
finished in a much shorter time than in the beginning of
the operation.</p>

<p>In making animal charcoal on a large scale there are
obtained from 2000 lbs. of raw material:</p>

<p>
Animal charcoal, 1180 to 1220 lbs.<br />
Ammoniacal liquor, 178 to 180 lbs.<br />
Gas, 222 to 248 cubic yards.<br />
</p>

<p>However, these figures refer only to bones degreased by
steaming, whereby a considerable portion of the cartilaginous
substance passes into solution in the form of glue. In
working bones degreased with benzine, larger yields than
those indicated above are as a rule obtained. The ammoniacal
liquor contains on an average 10 per cent. of ammonia.
The gas freed from carbonic acid yields 2.7 times more
light than good coal-gas.</p>


<h4>6. PROCESS FOR THE SIMULTANEOUS UTILIZATION OF THE
BONES FOR FAT, GLUE AND CALCIUM PHOSPHATE.</h4>

<p>This process differs from the one previously described in
that, in addition to the total quantity of fat and glue-yielding
substance contained in the bones, the mineral salts
are also obtained in a pure state, and can be further
utilized.</p>

<p>The bones are degreased either by extraction with benzine
or carbon disulphide or steaming, the operation in the
latter case being continued so long as fat is yielded by the
bones. The resulting glue-liquor is used in place of water
for boiling the cartilage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>The bones are placed in large wooden vats furnished
with well-fitting lids, and hydrochloric acid of 12 per cent.
poured over them so that they are covered a few inches
deep. With the use of acid of 1.04 specific gravity the
greater portion of the salts contained in the bones will pass
into solution in 48 to 72 hours, when the solution is drawn
off as completely as possible from the vats.</p>

<p>The residue in the vats is treated with less concentrated
hydrochloric acid and left in contact with it until the bones
are soft and flexible and the thinner pieces have become
translucent, this being a proof that all the mineral salts
have been extracted, and nothing but pure cartilaginous
substance remains behind. The solution is then drawn off,
and after pouring repeatedly small quantities of pure water
over the cartilage to expel the last remnants of acid liquor,
it is subjected to thorough washing until the last traces of
acid have been removed.</p>

<p>The resulting cartilage is white, translucent, and water-soaked.
If left in this state it would of course soon putrefy,
and it is best to work it at once, or if this cannot be done
it will have to be treated with carbolic acid in the manner
previously described, or dried.</p>

<p>Drying the cartilage is time-consuming work, and can
properly be done only by artificial heat in kilns. If carefully
protected from moisture, thoroughly dried cartilage
may be kept without injury for any length of time. However,
before being worked to glue, such material has to be
again soaked in water previous to the actual boiling operation,
and this process requires considerable time. It is
therefore best to preserve it in carbolic acid solution, which
only needs to be drawn off when the cartilage is to be
worked, and may be further utilized.</p>

<p>If boiled in open vessels with water, 6 to 8 hours are
required for the complete disintegration of the cartilage.
In a closed apparatus under high pressure solution is
effected in a much shorter time and the operation pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>gresses
very smoothly. With proper attention the glue
obtained from bones degreased with benzine and freed from
bone-earth by extraction with hydrochloric acid is, as a
rule, very clear, and may be bleached with sulphurous acid.</p>

<p>The extraction of the phosphates from bones may be
effected in a very suitable manner as follows: A number of
vats filled with bones are placed in terraces one above the
other, and the acid is allowed to run first into the uppermost
vat. After having been for several hours in contact
with the bones it is discharged into the next vat, fresh acid
being run into the first one, and so on. By this process a
highly concentrated solution of phosphates is in a few hours
obtained in the lowest vat, solution still adhering to the
bones in the other vats being finally expelled by water.</p>

<p>However, the process of extraction under decreased pressure
is the most advantageous, it requiring least time. For
this purpose the bones are brought into a vessel which can
be closed air-tight and the air is expelled. When but a
slight air-pressure prevails in the vessel, the cock of a reservoir
filled with hydrochloric acid is opened, the external
air-pressure now forcing hydrochloric acid into the extracting
vessel.</p>

<p>Bones, as viewed under the microscope, consist of a mass
permeated with numerous minute tubes or pores. When
the air is expelled from the vessel containing the bones, the
air in the pores of the latter is rarefied and the hollow
spaces are filled with hydrochloric acid whereby solution of
the phosphates is effected.</p>

<p>The yield of glue obtained from cartilage after extraction
of the mineral constituents varies according to the compactness
of the bones used. Solid and compact bones yield, on
an average, 15 per cent. of dry glue, but a comparatively
large quantity of calcium phosphate. On the other hand,
porous bones rich in cartilage yield from 20 to 25 per cent.
of dry glue. The liquor obtained by treating the bones
contains, as previously mentioned, calcium phosphate, mag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>nesium
phosphate and calcium chloride in solution, and
may be utilized in the manufacture of fertilizers or of phosphorus.</p>

<p>For the first purpose which is not very remunerative, but
is not very troublesome, the liquor is treated with milk of
lime until it is slightly alkaline, whereby a finely divided
precipitate of basic calcium phosphate is obtained, whilst
calcium chloride remains in solution. The precipitate is
allowed to settle, separated from the supernatant fluid and
dried. The resulting product contains, on an average, 65
per cent. calcium phosphate, up to 20 per cent. water and
10 to 15 per cent. calcium carbonate, quick lime and accidental
impurities. It forms an excellent fertilizer.</p>

<p>If the liquor is to be utilized in the manufacture of phosphorus,
it is evaporated in shallow pans of glazed stoneware.
In cooling crystals of acid calcium phosphate are formed,
which are separated from the mother-liquor. This subject
will be more fully referred to in the next chapter.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />

<small>MANUFACTURE OF PHOSPHORUS.</small></h3>


<p>In some instances the preparation of phosphorus is carried
on in conjunction with other industries, for instance,
glue-boiling, the preparation of sal ammoniac, yellow prussiate
of potash, etc. Bone-ash is the chief material used by
phosphorus makers. Many manufacturers do not burn the
bones to ashes, but purchase bone-ash, large quantities of
which are brought from South America, especially from the
Argentine Republic.</p>

<p>The ordinary method of preparing phosphorus includes
the following operations:</p>

<p>1. Burning the bones and grinding the bone-ash to
powder.</p>

<p>2. Decomposition of the bone-ash by sulphuric acid, and
evaporation of the acid phosphate previously mixed with
charcoal.</p>

<p>3. The distillation of the phosphorus.</p>

<p>4. The refining and purifying the phosphorus.</p>

<p><i>Burning the bones to ash.</i> The object of the ignition of
the bones is the complete destruction of the organic matter.
The operation is conducted in a kiln very similar to those
in use for burning lime. A layer of brush-wood having
been put on the bottom of the kiln, bones form the next
stratum, and so on alternately. The wood having been
lighted, the combustion of the bones ensues. In order to
carry off the fumes, the smell of which is very offensive, a
hood made of boiler-plate is placed on the kiln, and either
connected with a tall chimney, or the smoke and gases are
conducted into the fire of the kiln and burnt. The white
burnt bones are withdrawn through an opening reserved in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
the wall on purpose, the kiln being kept continuously in
operation, as in the case with some lime kilns.</p>

<p>This kind of kiln, however, possesses many disadvantages,
and an improved form, as proposed by Fleck, is shown in
Fig. 50.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 50.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p118.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The actual combustion chamber consists of a shaft, <i>A</i>,
composed of two inverted cones. In the lowest portion of
the lower cone are four or six apertures, <i>b</i>, which terminate
in inclined channels and serve as air-flues, as well as for
withdrawing the burnt bones. Through the aperture <i>a</i> in
the upper portion of the shaft additional bones may be introduced.
This aperture is covered with a heavy iron lid.</p>

<p>As will be seen from the illustration, the shaft contracts
towards the top in the form of a retort and passes into a
horizontal channel <i>B</i> which is provided, near its beginning,
with an ordinary fire-place <i>d</i>. The gases and fumes escaping
from the burning bones must pass over the flame of the
fire-place <i>d</i>, and are thereby so completely consumed to
water, carbonic acid and free nitrogen that no odor is perceptible
even in the immediate neighborhood of the kiln.</p>

<p>In order not to lose the heat yielded by the fire-place <i>d</i>
and the burning vapors, the channel <i>B</i> is covered with
shallow pans <i>P</i>, for the evaporation of such fluids as have
to be subjected to this treatment in the factory.</p>

<p>The mode of operation with a kiln of this construction is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
as follows: The shaft is filled two-thirds full with bones and
dry wood split in small pieces is placed in the channels
<i>b</i> and simultaneously ignited. Four or six long hot flames
thus strike the bones, the latter becoming in a short time so
highly heated that they commence to burn briskly and
ignite fresh portions of bones introduced through the aperture
<i>a</i>.</p>

<p>The white burnt bones in the lower portion of the kiln
are withdrawn, while in a glowing state, by means of iron
hooks; the next layer of bones sinks down and fresh
material is introduced through <i>a</i>, the kiln being thus kept
continuously in operation.</p>

<p>The quantity of substance which remains after burning
the bones depends of course on the quality of the material
used. Tubular bones of old animals contain the largest
quantity of mineral substance, and give a much more
abundant yield of bone-ash than the spongy bones of
younger animals. On an average 100 parts by weight of
fresh bones yield 55 parts by weight of bone-ash. The
composition of the latter is as follows:</p>

<p>
Basic calcium phosphate, 80 to 84 per cent.<br />
Basic magnesium phosphate, 2 to 3 per cent.<br />
Calcium carbonate, } 10 to 14 per cent.<br />
Calcium fluoride,&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />
</p>

<p>The bone-ash thus obtained is converted into a coarse
powder by means of machinery, a bone-mill being best
suited for the purpose. Experience has shown that the
granules obtained by grinding should be the size of lentils.
With the use of larger pieces the acid, with which the ash
is treated later on, does not penetrate the entire thickness
of the bone mass and a portion of the latter remains undecomposed.
If the granules are too small, lumps are
formed when the ash is brought together with the acid, and
the mass would have to be constantly stirred in order to,
make the action of the acid effective.</p>

<p><i>Decomposition of the bone-ash by sulphuric acid.</i> When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
the basic calcium phosphate—the constituent of the bone-ash
which comes here into consideration—is brought in
contact with an acid of sufficient strength to effect its decomposition,
calcium sulphate (gypsum) is formed, and a
solution of acid calcium phosphate. If the latter be mixed
with powdered charcoal, evaporated to dryness, and the
mixture exposed, with the exclusion of air, to a strong red
heat, the acid calcium phosphate is first converted into calcium
metaphosphate, water being yielded. At this high
temperature the calcium metaphosphate is by the action of
the carbon decomposed to basic calcium phosphate and
phosphorus; the latter escapes in the form of vapor and
may be caught in suitable condensing vessels.</p>

<p>Hence three separate processes have to be distinguished:
1. The formation of acid calcium phosphate from the basic
calcium phosphate contained in the bone-ash. 2. The conversion
of the acid calcium phosphate into calcium metaphosphate.
3. Decomposition of the calcium metaphosphate,
phosphorus being liberated, while basic calcium
phosphate remains behind.</p>

<p>Expressed in chemical symbols these processes may be
embodied in the following equations:</p>

</table></div>

<p>If the processes mentioned under II. and III. would pass
off in the practice exactly as there stated, two-thirds, or 13.3
per cent., of the total quantity of phosphorus contained in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
the basic calcium phosphate originally present would be
obtained. However, besides these processes, others take
place which cause a loss of phosphorus. By the action of
the red heat upon the acid calcium phosphate, reciprocal
action takes place between the latter, the water and carbon,
so that a portion of the water is decomposed, and in addition
to carbon monoxide, phosphoretted hydrogen is formed;
the phosphorus contained in the latter must be considered
as lost. Furthermore, a portion of the phosphorus is lost
in the form of vapor, even with the use of the best condensing
contrivances. In consequence of these losses the actual
yield of phosphorus is between 8 and 11 per cent.</p>

<p>The formation of acid calcium phosphate may be effected
either cold or with the assistance of heat, less time being
required in the latter case. The process without the assistance
of heat is as follows:</p>

<p>The bone-ash is brought into a lead-lined wooden tank, and
enough boiling water to cover it poured in. It is then thoroughly
mixed with the water by vigorous stirring with
wooden rakes, and the necessary quantity of sulphuric acid
is then run in with constant stirring. When an intimate
mixture has been effected, the tank is covered with a well-fitting
lid and allowed to stand for a few hours. As heat
has been liberated by the introduction of the sulphuric acid
into the mixture prepared with hot water, the entire mass
acquires a high temperature.</p>

<p>Decomposition is accelerated by stirring the contents of
the tank every six hours, and the process may be supposed
to be finished in 48 hours. With the use of fresh burnt
ash no special phenomena are observed, but if the ash has
been prepared for some time the caustic lime formed in
burning the bones has been completely converted into carbonate
of lime, and the carbonic acid escapes, causing a
slight foaming of the mass. In addition to carbonic acid,
there also escapes a certain quantity of hydrogen fluoride
gas, which is liberated by the decomposition of the calcium<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
fluoride present in the ash. This gas being, even in very
small quantities, very injurious to health, the tanks should
be placed in a thoroughly ventilated room.</p>

<p>When decomposition is complete, enough water is admitted
for the mass to acquire by stirring a thick milky
appearance, when it is allowed to rest until it clarifies and
a perfectly clear solution of acid calcium phosphate stands
over the precipitate of gypsum. The clear solution is drawn
off, and the sediment washed with water to obtain the solution
retained by it. For this purpose the gypsum is stirred
up with water, and the thick fluid discharged into a filtering
tank. Upon the bottom of the latter is a four-inch-deep
layer of coarse quartz sand; upon this is placed a false
bottom, and upon the latter is spread a linen cloth. The
liquor first running off being milky is poured back into the
tank. However, it runs off clear so soon as the pores of the
filtering cloth have become somewhat contracted by the
gypsum.</p>

<p>As a rule, the contents of several filtering vats are run
into a common filter, and the mass is repeatedly allowed to
drain off. The dilute solutions thus obtained are evaporated
with the first liquor. A third lixiviation of the sediment
yields a fluid which is used instead of water in a subsequent
operation.</p>

<p>The residue of gypsum is taken from the filtering tanks,
and may be used as a fertilizer.</p>

<p>In the warm way the decomposition of the bone-ash is
effected by providing the decomposing tanks with lead
pipes through which steam is introduced, decomposition
being complete in 24 hours, and the first run of solution
of acid calcium phosphate reaches the evaporating pan in a
very hot state. The lixiviation of the gypsum residue is
also effected with water heated by steam, the object of
separating the acid calcium phosphate as much as possible
from the gypsum being thus obtained more completely with
a comparatively small quantity of water than is possible by
washing with cold water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>A suitable apparatus for hot lixiviation is shown in Figs.
51 and 52 in cross section and profile. A lead-lined tank,
13 to 16 feet in diameter and 3½ feet deep, is fitted with a
stirrer furnished with two or four paddles, and closed by a
well-fitting lid. The stirrer is kept in motion during the
entire operation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 51.</span></div>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 52.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p123-2.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A lead steam pipe <i>D</i> furnished with several narrow flat
outlet pipes placed in the direction in which the stirrer
revolves, lies about 4 inches above the bottom of the tank.
<i>W</i> is the pipe for the admission of water, <i>S</i> the lead pipe
connected with the sulphuric acid reservoir, and <i>A</i> an outlet
of boards for carrying off the vapor evolved from the
mass in admitting the sulphuric acid. <i>R</i> is a wooden
hopper, which serves for the introduction of the bone-ash,
and is removed when the tank has been filled, the aperture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
being closed with a well-fitting wooden lid. The bottom
of the tank is furnished with a lead discharge-cock.</p>

<p>Water is run into the tank, the bone-ash being simultaneously
introduced through the hopper <i>R</i>, and the stirrer
allowed to revolve slowly to effect an intimate mixture.
Sulphuric acid and steam are then at the same time admitted.
The steam heats the fluid very quickly to the
boiling-point, and assists the action of the stirrer, it passing
out from the outlet pipes in the same direction in which the
stirrer revolves.</p>

<p>When the required quantity of sulphuric acid has been
introduced, the admission of steam is interrupted, the
stirrer, however, being constantly kept in motion. To keep
the mass hot, steam is for a few minutes admitted every
hour. When the sulphuric acid has acted for 24 hours,
decomposition is complete, and the liquor is discharged
through the cock on the bottom of the tank.</p>

<p>For the evaporation of the liquor leaden pans are used,
and this operation is continued until the fluid has attained
a specific gravity of 1.45. The pans rest upon cast-iron
plates covered with a layer of clay or sand, to prevent them
from being injured by the fire gases. For heating the
pans, the fire gases escaping from the distilling furnace or
the bone kiln are utilized.</p>

<p>The fluid having been evaporated to the above-mentioned
specific gravity is now mixed with charcoal powder, or
rather granulated charcoal of the size of small peas, in the
proportion of 20 to 25 parts of charcoal to 100 of liquor.
The mixture is then quickly dried in shallow cast-iron pans
heated by a direct fire. Much sulphurous acid is evolved
during this operation, and provision must be made for
carrying off the vapors arising from the pans.</p>

<p>When the mass has been dehydrated so far that it balls
together, it is taken from the pan by means of shovels and
brought into a copper cylinder which is furnished with a
sheet-iron sieve-like bottom through which it is forced into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
another pan. In this second pan the mass is moderately
heated until a sample of it still evolves slight vapors and
when pressed with the hand, after cooling somewhat, appears
still moist without, however, being sticky. The
material is now ready for distilling and 100 parts of concentrated
solution of 1.45 specific gravity and 20 to 25 parts
of charcoal yield about 77 parts by weight of so-called distilling
mass.</p>

<p>It is best to bring the hot mass as taken from the pan at
once into the retorts, as it is very hygroscopic and, if allowed
to lie exposed to the air, would absorb moisture and require
to be again dried. If it cannot be immediately subjected
to distillation, it is advisable to keep it in sheet-metal boxes
tightly closed.</p>

<p>The liquor obtained in treating bones for the manufacture
of glue with hydrochloric acid may, as mentioned in Chapter
V, be advantageously utilized in the manufacture of
phosphorus. In order to obtain in crystallized form the
acid calcium phosphate contained in it, the liquor has to
be concentrated by evaporation and as during this operation
hydrochloric acid vapors constantly escape, provision
must be made for their removal from the workroom. The
operation is conducted as follows: The flue of the furnace
for distilling the phosphorus, through which the fire gases
usually escape to the chimney, is made to communicate
with a long low chamber, which can be tightly closed and
connects at the other end with a high chimney. The flue
is fitted with a slide and by opening the latter, the fire
gases are forced to pass through the chamber before reaching
the chimney.</p>

<p>In the chamber are placed large, well-glazed, earthenware
vessels which contain the liquor to be evaporated, the
vapors evolved being carried off by the fire-gases through
the chimney. Evaporation proceeds quite rapidly, and
fresh liquor is from time to time introduced through an
earthenware pipe, the operation being repeated until a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
sample taken from the full vessels shows on cooling the
presence of an abundance of crystals of acid calcium phosphate.</p>

<p>The admission of the fire-gases into the chamber is then
interrupted, and the contents of the vessels are brought into
a wooden tank furnished with a stirrer, which is kept in
constant motion so that when the liquor cools, only small
crystals will be formed. When crystallization is complete,
the mother-liquor is drawn off and again evaporated. By
this operation more crystals of acid calcium phosphate are
obtained, which are, however, less pure than those from the
first liquor. The mother-liquor drawn off from this second
yield of crystals might, on being again evaporated, give
more crystals which, however, would be too impure to be
used to advantage.</p>

<p>To obtain the calcium phosphate contained in the last
mother-liquor, the latter is exactly neutralized with burnt
lime, a white precipitate of basic calcium phosphate being
thereby obtained. The precipitate is repeatedly washed in
water and allowed to settle, and added in small portions to
the acid liquors obtained by extracting the bones. As
these liquors always contain a considerable quantity of
hydrochloric acid in excess, the basic calcium phosphate,
being in a finely divided state, is readily and completely
dissolved.</p>

<p>The crystals of acid calcium phosphate are removed from
the crystallizing tanks by means of wooden shovels and
brought into baskets covered inside with stout sack-cloth.
They are left in the baskets until no more mother-liquor
drains off, when the cloths are folded together and the
crystals further freed from liquor by pressure. They are
then heated, with constant stirring, in shallow stoneware
pans until they are so dry as to crumble of their own
accord. In this manner small crystals of a mother-of-pearl
lustre are obtained, which feel like sharp quartz sand and
consist of pure acid calcium phosphate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>This mass is mixed with 25 per cent. of its weight of
granulated charcoal. The mixture is heated until it is
pulverulent, and then treated in the same manner as the
distilling mass from bone-ash.</p>

<p>In place of stoneware vessels, shallow lead pans may be
used for evaporating the liquor containing calcium phosphate.
To prevent the melting of the lead the pans are
bricked in under a very flat arch, so that the fire gases are
forced to pass close over the liquor, the pans being kept
constantly full. When crystallization is complete the liquor
is drawn off and the pans are refilled.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of phosphorus there is left after
every distillation a residue of basic calcium phosphate, and
it is advisable to decompose it with hydrochloric acid, this
being effected in a vat lined with lead or coated with paraffine.
The mass is completely dissolved, and the black
sludge remaining on the bottom of the vat consists of charcoal,
which had been added to the distilling mass.</p>

<p><i>Distillation of the Phosphorus.</i>—The distilling mass consists
of acid calcium phosphate, charcoal and about 4 to 6
per cent. water. By heating in the retorts, the acid calcium
phosphate is first converted into calcium metaphosphate,
water being eliminated, according to the following equation:</p>

<p class="center">CaH<sub>4</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> = Ca(PO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>By further heating to a white heat the calcium metaphosphate
is so far reduced as to yield two-thirds of its content
of phosphorus, while one-third remains behind as calcium
phosphate, corresponding to the following equation:</p>

<p class="center"><a id="Ca"></a>3Ca(PO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 10C = Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 10CO + 4P.</p>

<p>The mixture of acid calcium phosphate and charcoal is
distilled in glazed fire-clay retorts, 12 to 18 of them being
placed on each side of a so-called galley-furnace. The
bodies of the retorts are placed on the side of the fire, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
the necks pass through openings in the walls of the furnace,
those portions of the wall being only lightly bricked up, as
the retorts, after distillation is finished and the furnace
cooled, have to be removed in order to clear out the residue
and introduce fresh mixture. Between each pair of retorts
is left a space of 5 to 6 inches for the passage of the flames.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 53.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p128.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Experience, however, has proved the advisability of modifying
the galley-furnace by reducing its length and increasing
its height, and placing the retorts in two or three rows,
one above the other. Two such furnaces are placed together
with their narrow sides, so that the fire-gases of both meet
in a common chamber, and are conducted from the latter
under the evaporating pans. Four such furnaces may also
be arranged in the form of a cross, and their fire-gases conducted
into a common chamber. By arranging the furnace,
as is most frequently done, for three double rows of seven
retorts each, it will hold 42 retorts, a double furnace 84,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
and one in the form of a cross 168. The arrangement of a
double furnace is shown in Fig. 53.</p>

<p>The wall <i>C</i>, which separates the two fire-places, serves for
supporting the lowest row of retorts, while the second and
third rows rest upon intermediate pieces. The fire gases
pass through flues into the space over the furnace, the top
of which may be directly formed by the evaporating pans.
It is, however, more suitable to place the evaporating pans
on one side and not run the collecting chamber for the fire
gases directly into the chimney. For the introduction of
the retorts into, and their removal from, the furnace, a
narrow door is provided between each two vertical rows of
retorts. After placing the retorts in the furnace, this door
is closed with stones and the joints luted with clay.</p>

<p>Every three retorts lying one above the other have a
common receiver, <i>p</i>, for the collection of the phosphorus
distilled off. The necks, <i>r</i>, of the retorts terminate in the
collecting pipe, <i>o</i>.</p>

<p>The galley-furnaces, previously described, require the use
of a fuel which yields a very long flame, and can, therefore,
be heated only with wood or very fat coal.</p>

<p>In order to render possible the use as fuel of coal yielding
a short flame, and especially of coke, furnaces have been
constructed which hold only a small number of retorts, generally
five, placed in two rows, by twos and threes, one above
the other. The retorts are cylindrical in form, and have a
capacity equal to that of several smaller retorts.</p>

<p>The <i>receivers</i> for collecting the phosphorus distilling over
from the retorts are made of clay, and should be well glazed
and smooth inside. Each receiver consists of two parts, one
of which is a cylindrical vessel open at the top, into which
the other part fits, and is fixed by means of a rim, which is
prolonged so as to form a neck, between which and the first
part is inserted a tube fitted on the neck of the retort, while
the other end of this tube dips for about 4 inches into the
receiver, the latter being filled with water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

<p>Under certain conditions enameled cast-iron may be used
as a material for receivers, but the enamel must be of such
a nature as not to be attacked by the phosphorus vapors,
otherwise the receivers would in a short time be destroyed.</p>

<p>The retorts having been filled with the required quantity
of mixture are placed in the furnace and the brickwork is
restored. The fire is then kindled and kept up very gently
for some time in order to dry the fire clay used in joining
the bricks. The receivers are filled with water and fitted
to the retorts. In each receiver a small iron spoon is placed
fastened to iron wire which serves as a stem. After six to
eight hours of firing the heat has been so much increased
as to cause the expulsion of any moisture left in the material
placed in the retorts, while quantities of hydrocarbon
gases and oxide of carbon are formed and expelled with the
sulphurous acid. Subsequently other gases are given off,
and because they contain some hydrogen phosphide are
spontaneously inflammable. As soon as this phenomenon
is observed the joints of the receivers and apparatus connecting
it with the retorts are luted with clay, care being
taken to leave, by the insertion of an iron wire, a small
opening for the escape of the gases, which are as speedily
as possible removed by well arranged ventilators from the
building in which the furnace is placed. The appearance
of amorphous phosphorus at the small opening indicates
the commencement of the distillation.</p>

<p>The spoon is then placed in the receiver in such a direction
that any phosphorus coming over may collect in it.
During the progress of the operation, and as long as any
phosphorus distils over, the evolution of combustible gases
continues, and consequently a small blue-colored flame is
observed at the opening in the lute. The water in the
receiver is kept cool during the operation. After forty-six
hours, with greatly-increased firing, a full white heat is
reached, and the quantity of phosphorus coming over has
decreased so much as to make a continuation of the ignition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
process wasteful. The receivers are therefore disconnected
from the retorts.</p>

<p>The receivers are taken to a special room and entirely
submerged in large wooden troughs filled with water in
order to drive off inflammable gases still contained in them
and to cover the phosphorus with water. They should be
opened only after this has been done, and every manufacturer
should rigidly enforce the rule of carrying on the
operation in the above-described manner. Crude phosphorus
is very inflammable, and when carelessly handled
by the workmen may inflict horrible burns and, as the
phosphorus as a rule causes blood-poisoning, such injuries
generally cause death.</p>

<p>The phosphorus is then removed from the receivers
(always under water). The trough in which this operation
is effected should be provided, a few inches above the actual
bottom, with a perforated false bottom upon which the
receivers are placed. The larger pieces of phosphorus
taken from the receivers are collected, under water, in
special vessels, while the smaller pieces fall through the
perforations of the false bottom to the actual bottom.
When all the receivers have been emptied, the water in the
trough is discharged into a large barrel in which it remains
until the particles of phosphorus have subsided. The
water is then drawn off, with the exception of a sufficient
quantity to cover the phosphorus in the barrel.</p>

<p>The water from the receivers as well as from the troughs
shows a quite strong acid reaction due to phosphoric acid,
which has been formed by the combustion of phosphorus
and passed into solution. In order not to lose this phosphoric
acid, the water is partly used for filling the receivers
and partly for mixing the bone-ash before adding the sulphuric
acid.</p>

<p>Crude phosphorus is a mixture of crystalline (ordinary)
phosphorus with amorphous phosphorus, the reddish color
of the mass being due to the latter. It further contains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
phosphorus in various stages of oxidation, free carbon, and
if impure sulphuric acid has been used, arsenic in combination
with phosphorus.</p>

<p><i>Refining and purifying the phosphorus.</i> The crude phosphorus
was formerly purified by forcing it through the
pores of stout wash leather by means of a machine. The
crude phosphorus contained in a tightly tied piece of wash
leather is placed on a perforated copper support situated in
a vessel filled with water at 122° to 140° F. As soon as
the phosphorus is molten, there is placed on the wash
leather a wooden plate which by the aid of a mechanical
arrangement and a lever can be forced downwards so as to
cause the fluid phosphorus to pass through the pores of the
leather, the impurities being retained. The phosphorus in
the form of a slightly yellowish fluid collects on the bottom
of the vessel and is immediately moulded into the shape in
which it is brought into commerce. The residue in the
wash leather consists chiefly of charcoal dust and amorphous
phosphorus. The wash leather can, as a rule, be
only used once, and only small quantities of phosphorus
can be worked at one time.</p>

<p>A more suitable process of purification is as follows:
Porous, unglazed porcelain or earthenware plates are fixed
in an iron cylinder connected with a steam boiler. The
cylinder having been hermetically closed is placed in a
vessel containing water at 140° F. When the phosphorus
is molten, steam of a few atmospheres’ pressure is admitted
into the cylinder, the phosphorus being thus forced through
the earthenware plates.</p>

<p>The phosphorus obtained by either of these methods is
free from mechanically admixed particles of charcoal and
amorphous phosphorus, but it is by no means pure, as all
the substances dissolved in it (oxides of phosphorus) pass
through the filter. The loss of phosphorus amounts to
from 5 to 6 per cent. of the weight of the crude product.
The masses taken from the filter plates are therefore col<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>lected
and subjected by themselves to distillation in order
to obtain the phosphorus contained in them.</p>

<p>To obtain pure phosphorus, the crude product has to be
subjected to distillation, this operation being carried on in
iron retorts of a peculiar make, and shaped like the glass
retorts used in chemical laboratories. The necks of these
retorts dip to a depth of ½ to ¾ inch in water contained in a
basin filled to the rim so that any phosphorus which is discharged
into this water causes it to overflow. The crude
phosphorus having been fused under water is next mixed
with 12 to 15 per cent. of its weight of moist sand, and this
mixture placed in the retorts, the object of the mixing with
sand being to prevent the phosphorus becoming ignited
during the filling of the retorts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 54.</span></div>

</div>

<p>Fig. 54 shows a distilling apparatus. In consists of a
cast-iron retort, <i>K</i>, fitted with a cast-iron dome, <i>H</i>, the joint
being made tight by means of clay and screws. The dome,
<i>A</i>, tapers to a cone and terminates in a wide glass tube, <i>R</i>,
bent at a right angle, and having at the mouth a diameter
of about 2⅓ inches.</p>

<p>This dome, <i>A</i>, dips ¾ inch deep in water contained in the
copper gutter of the receiver filled to the brim. The copper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
receiver, <i>P</i>, stands in water. It contracts below in the
form of a funnel, and terminates in a pipe closed by a cock,
<i>G</i>, to which is fitted a glass tube bent at a right angle.</p>

<p>The retort having been filled with the mixture of crude
phosphorus and sand, the dome, <i>H</i>, is placed in position and
the apparatus brought into the furnace. The dome is then
connected with the condensing apparatus.</p>

<p>The fire is so regulated that the retort is uniformly heated
from all sides in order to evaporate as quickly as possible
the water still adhering to the phosphorus mixture, since at
a higher temperature the water acts upon the phosphorus,
and phosphoretted hydrogen is formed. It being scarcely
possible to entirely avoid the formation of the latter, the
receiver has been given the above-described form, so that
the disagreeable vapors formed by the ignition of the phosphoretted
hydrogen cannot escape into the workroom. The
gas escapes through the conical dome. <i>A</i>, and the glass pipe,
<i>R</i>, into the open air, where it burns without molesting the
workmen.</p>

<p>At first steam only escapes from the retort, while later
on phosphoretted hydrogen passes off. The evolution of
the latter, however, soon ceases almost entirely, and the
phosphorus distils uniformly over. Heating is continued
until the retort shows a slight red heat, all the phosphorus
having by that time passed over. The residue in the
retort consists only of sand and charcoal.</p>

<p>The phosphorus passing over in the various stages of distillation
shows different qualities. The portion which
passes over first is perfectly pure, and when cold presents
the appearance of bleached wax; the portions passing over
later on are of a yellowish-red color, while the last portions
are colored brick-red by amorphous phosphorus, and have
to be collected by themselves. They are again brought
into the retort in the subsequent operation.</p>

<p>In order to be able to separate the phosphorus passing
over according to quality, the receiver for the melted mass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
is fitted with a conical bottom furnished with a glass tube
which can be closed by the cock <i>G</i>. This glass pipe leads
to a tank filled with warm water, in which the collecting
vessel is immersed. The phosphorus collecting in this
vessel is from time to time allowed to run into a vessel
filled with water, another vessel being substituted when the
phosphorus commences to show a yellowish color.</p>

<p><i>Moulding the refined phosphorus.</i> It has long been the
custom to mould phosphorus into the shape of sticks formed
by the aid of a glass tube open at both ends, one of these
being placed in molten phosphorus covered by a stratum of
warm water. The liquid phosphorus is sucked by the
operator into the tube until it is quite filled. The lower
opening of the tube being kept under water is closed by the
finger of the operator; the tube is instantly transferred to a
vessel filled with very cold water by which the phosphorus
is solidified. It is removed from the glass tube by pushing
it out with a glass rod or iron wire while being held under
water.</p>

<p>Independent of its danger, the method of moulding above
described is not suitable for the manufacture on a large scale,
and various contrivances have been introduced for this purpose;
the apparatus constructed by Seubert being much used.
It consists of a copper boiler fitted on a furnace. To the flat
bottom of this boiler is fitted by hard solder an open copper
trough communicating with a water-tank. In the boiler is
fitted a copper funnel provided with a horizontal tube.
This portion of the apparatus is intended for the reception
of the phosphorus. At the end of the horizontal tube is
placed a stopcock, while the portion of the projecting
mouth of the tube beyond the cock is widened out and fitted
by means of bolts and nuts, with a flange-like copper plate,
into which are inserted two glass tubes. Into the copper
trough is let a wooden partition, which serves the purpose
of supporting the glass tubes as well as of preventing the
communication of the hot water in the boiler and a portion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
of the trough with the cold water of the tank and the portion
of the trough nearest to it. The phosphorus having
been introduced in the boiler, the water is gently warmed
so as to cause the fusion of the phosphorus. As the warm
water reaches to the wooden partition, it is evident that on
opening and closing the cock at the end of the horizontal
tube, some phosphorus will pass through and flow out of the
glass tubes, but that remaining in these tubes will solidify,
and on opening again the cock at the end of the horizontal
tube, the solid sticks of phosphorus may be removed from
the glass tubes by taking hold of the piece of projecting
phosphorus, the phosphorus being immediately immersed
under water in the tank, and kept there protected from the
action of the light.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding its apparently very practical arrangement,
Seubert’s apparatus possesses many disadvantages,
the principal drawback to its use being that the phosphorus-sticks
frequently stick so firmly in the glass tubes that the
operation of moulding has to be interrupted, the tubes
removed, and the phosphorus stick pushed out with a stout
wire. Furthermore, the melted phosphorus in flowing in
frequently causes the glass tubes to crack.</p>

<p>Hence many factories have returned to the old method
of moulding by sucking the fused phosphorus into glass
tubes. To render this operation perfectly free from danger,
the apparatus shown in Fig. 55 has been devised, by means
of which a larger quantity of phosphorus can in a short
time be moulded into sticks.</p>

<p>A hollow prism, <i>P</i>, of stout sheet-iron is fitted at its lower
end with 8 to 12 short tubes. In the latter are inserted
air-tight, by means of rubber, 12 glass tubes, <i>G</i>, each about
3¼ feet long and somewhat contracted at the lower end.
Two iron rods, <i>E</i>, are fitted to the prism and, by means of
suitably-shaped pieces of cork, serve to hold the glass tubes
in their proper position. To the back of the prism is
secured a rubber tube, <i>L</i>, which communicates with a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
air-pump, and to the upper surface of the prism is fixed a
handle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 55.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p137.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The phosphorus to be moulded is fused in a shallow vessel
of such a shape that a portion of it is covered only about
2 inches deep with water. The glass tubes are placed in
the fused phosphorus and the air is sucked from them by
means of the air-pump; the external air-pressure forcing the
fused phosphorus into the glass tube.</p>

<p>The tubes are now sufficiently raised to allow of a rubber
plate being pushed under their mouths in the shallower
portion of the vessel. The rubber plate is pressed against
the tubes and the entire apparatus placed in a vessel filled
with cold water. The phosphorus solidifies very rapidly in
the lower narrower portions of the tubes, and the latter are
immediately detached from the prism and replaced by
others. The phosphorus when entirely cold is pushed from
the glass tubes by means of a wire or wooden stick.</p>

<p>In some factories the phosphorus is moulded in wedge-shaped
sheet-metal boxes. In packing two such wedges
are laid together with their longitudinal sides so as to form
a prism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

<p>Phosphorus is stored either in strong sheet-iron tanks or
in wooden boxes lined with tinned sheet-iron and covered
with a stratum of water fully 1¼ inches deep. For shipping
smaller quantities of phosphorus, the sticks are packed in
tinned sheet-iron boxes and the latter having been filled up
with water, the lid is soldered on. To prevent the water
from freezing in winter, it is advisable to mix it with spirits
of wine.</p>

<p><i>Manufacture of phosphorus with the assistance of electricity.</i>
Readman and Parker have recently devised a process for
the manufacture of phosphorus on a large scale in a continuously
working apparatus by means of a powerful electric
current, such as is yielded by a larger dynamo. The mixture
used for the operation differs from the ordinary one of
calcium phosphate and charcoal, in that it contains in addition
a slag-forming body—a flux—silicic acid (quartz
sand) being at first used for the purpose. Numerous experiments,
however, have shown kaolin or pipe clay, <i>i. e.</i>,
aluminium silicate, to be more suitable.</p>

<p>When a mixture of calcium phosphate, charcoal and
aluminium silicate is exposed to the action of the voltaic
arc the following process takes place: By the extraordinarily
high temperature prevailing in the proximity of
the arc, the reduction to phosphorus of the phosphoric acid
contained in the calcium phosphate is very rapidly effected.
The liberated calcium combines immediately with the aluminium
silicate to a calcium-aluminium-silicate, <i>i. e.</i>, to a
glass fusible with the greatest difficulty which, however, at
the high temperature possessed by the voltaic arc becomes
fluid like water.</p>

<p>The apparatus employed is, generally speaking, similar to
the electric furnaces now in use. The mass to be treated is
contained in a carbon crucible in which the two electrodes
are placed opposite to one another, so that the electric current
must pass through the mass. However, since the
phosphorus at the moment of liberation would, on coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
in contact with oxygen, immediately burn again to phosphorus
pentoxide, the apparatus has to be so arranged that
the entire process passes off in an entirely indifferent gas,
and the condensation of the phosphorus vapors takes place
under the same conditions.</p>

<p>Fig. 56 shows the apparatus employed for the electrolytic
manufacture of phosphorus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 56.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p139.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The carbon crucible, <i>a</i>, is enclosed by a clay jacket,
which serves as an insulator of heat, and is closed by a
graphite cover, <i>c</i>. Through the bottom and the cover of
the crucible pass the two electrodes, <i>k k</i>, which conduct the
current, and between which the voltaic arc is formed. To
prevent the upper electrode from becoming too highly
heated during the operation, it is constantly cooled by
water admitted at <i>g</i>, and running off at <i>f</i>. Through the
pipes <i>h</i> and <i>l</i> an indifferent gas—as a rule, illuminating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
gas—is conducted into the apparatus and escapes together
with the phosphorus vapors through the pipe <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>In operating with the apparatus, the reduction soon takes
place, and the phosphorus vapors escape through <i>d</i>, while
a thinly-fluid slag remains behind in the crucible. The
slag is discharged through a pipe not shown in the illustration,
and a fresh charge of the mixture brought into the
crucible <i>a</i>, the process of reduction being thus carried on
without interruption. The phosphorus vapors escaping
from <i>d</i> are conducted through a cooled pipe and condense
to a liquid in water heated to between 122° and 140° F.
contained in a receiver.</p>

<p>Although the electrolytic method of manufacturing phosphorus
is of quite recent origin, a considerable portion of
the phosphorus brought into commerce is now prepared in
that manner, it being cheaper than the older processes
which involve a very large consumption of fuel.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />

<small>METHODS OF BLEACHING GLUE.</small></h3>


<p>Many experiments have been made to bleach glue, <i>i. e.</i>,
to obtain masses as colorless as possible, or at least slightly
colored, the resulting product being more valuable than the
dark-colored one.</p>


<p class="center">a. <i>Bleaching in the Air.</i></p>

<p>The principal requisite for obtaining a beautiful bleached
glue is that the unbleached product is clear, <i>i. e.</i>, transparent,
even if of a dark color, this being the best criterion
of well-made glue.</p>

<p>Glue may be bleached whilst being prepared, or the
finished cakes may be subjected to the bleaching process.</p>

<p>For the purpose of obtaining pale-colored glue from skin
or cartilage it is advisable to expose the materials in thin
layers to the direct action of the sun. Moist oxygen when
acted upon by the sun is converted into ozone, which exerts
an extraordinary bleaching effect upon organic substances.</p>


<p class="center">b. <i>Bleaching with Chlorine.</i></p>

<p>The powerful bleaching effect of a solution of chlorine in
water upon organic matter is well known; the water is
decomposed, and bleaching is effected by the oxygen which
is liberated. Hence skin and cartilage may also be bleached
by placing them in a vessel filled with weak solution of
chlorine in water and leaving them in contact with it until
the fluid shows no longer an odor of chlorine. When
bleaching is finished the materials are suspended in a certain
quantity of hydrochloric acid, which has finally to be
removed by repeated treatment with water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>


<p class="center">c. <i>Bleaching with Animal Charcoal.</i></p>

<p>Animal charcoal is distinguished by its great power of
absorbing coloring as well as odoriferous matter, and may
also be used for discoloring glue-liquors. This may be
done by allowing the thin liquor, as it comes from the
glue-boiler, to run through a filter filled with animal charcoal,
or with the use of charcoal dust.</p>

<p>In the latter case the glue-liquor is collected in a clarifying
vessel and a quantity of charcoal dust amounting to
about 3 to 4 per cent. of the weight of the glue in the
liquor stirred in. The finely divided charcoal sinks slowly
down, carrying with it the solid particles suspended in the
liquor, and collects on the bottom of the clarifying vessel
in the form of a black slime.</p>

<p>In order to discolor the glue-liquor as much as possible,
when working on a large scale, it is recommended to use a
number of cylinders filled with animal charcoal. These
cylinders are connected one with the other in such a manner
that the glue-liquor runs into the first cylinder from
the top, passes out from the lower end of this cylinder
through a pipe into the second cylinder, traverses this from
bottom to top, passes into the third cylinder from the top,
and so on. The animal charcoal in the first cylinder loses
its discoloring power first. The cylinder is then disengaged,
freshly charged and placed last in the series of
filters, the process being the same with the second cylinder,
and so on, so that after a certain time all the cylinders
have alternately occupied the first and last places in the
series of filters.</p>

<p>By the use of animal charcoal it is even possible to
render very dark and badly-smelling glue, entirely colorless
and free from odor. The darker the glue is, the longer it
must, of course, be subjected to the action of the animal
charcoal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>


<p class="center">d. <i>Bleaching with Sulphurous Acid.</i></p>

<p>Bleaching of the glue-liquor itself by means of sulphurous
acid is best effected in the clarifying vat. For this
purpose, the latter is fitted with a lead pipe reaching to the
bottom and terminating in a perforated coil. Through
this pipe gaseous sulphurous acid, generated in a suitable
sulphur-burner is forced through the liquor by means of a
force-pump.</p>

<p>The sulphurous acid is dissolved in the glue-liquor, the latter
being thereby bleached. When the liquor has acquired
a much paler color and a strong odor of sulphurous acid is
perceptible in the air over the vat, the introduction of
gaseous sulphurous acid is interrupted and the liquor allowed
quietly to clarify, the acid dissolved in it exerting
during this time a further bleaching effect. By this means
ordinary brown joiners’ glue of good quality may be converted
into a pale-yellow product similar to the variety
known as gilder’s glue.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 57.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p143.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>For bleaching finished glue, solution of sulphurous acid
in water may be used, the apparatus shown in Figs. 57 and
58 being suitable for the purpose.</p>

<p>The apparatus for the production of the acid solution
consists of the sulphur-burner <i>O</i>, the wash-vessel for the
gas <i>W</i>, and the vessel <i>T</i> for dissolving the gas in water.</p>

<p>The sulphur-burner <i>O</i> is a small brick vault of sufficient
size to hold a vessel <i>S</i> having a capacity of a few quarts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
In front the sulphur-burner is provided with a well-fitting
door <i>J</i>, which is furnished with a small aperture for the
introduction of an iron pipe into the burner. The lead-pipe
<i>R</i> leads from <i>O</i> to the bottom of the wash-vessel <i>W</i>,
and from the lid of the latter rises a pipe <i>R<sub>1</sub></i>, and runs
along the bottom of the trough filled with water. This
trough is provided with a wooden lid and the cock <i>H</i>, and
by means of the latter the fluid can be discharged into the
vessel <i>G</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 58.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p144.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The trough <i>T</i> is filled with water and <i>W</i> is also filled
three-quarters full. In the burner <i>O</i> is placed a dish <i>S</i>
filled with sulphur, and the latter ignited. The door is
then closed and air blown in through <i>A</i> by means of a
bellows, the joints of the door <i>J</i> being at the same time
luted with clay.</p>

<p>In contact with air, the sulphur burns to sulphur dioxide.
The latter is freed in the wash-vessel from sulphur vapor
which has been carried along, and passes from <i>R<sub>1</sub></i> through
the numerous perforations into the water in <i>T</i> where it is
dissolved to sulphurous acid.</p>

<p>Saturation with sulphurous acid of the fluid in the trough
is complete when the suffocating odor of the acid is perceptible
in the proximity of <i>T</i>. The fluid is then discharged,
replaced by water, which is again saturated with
sulphuric acid, and so on.</p>

<p>The cakes of glue to be bleached are placed in a trough
(Fig. 58), in which are arranged several frames, <i>B</i>, covered
with linen. The cakes of glue are placed upon these frames
and the trough is filled with sulphurous acid so that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
stands a few inches deep over the uppermost frame. The
cakes of glue swell up rapidly in the solution of sulphurous
acid, and yielding up their salts become bleached. After
twelve hours the fluid is discharged through the cock, <i>H</i>,
and if glue of a particularly fine appearance is to be produced
the cakes are treated twice more with solution of
sulphurous acid.</p>

<p>When bleaching is finished the trough is filled with
clean water, in which the glue is allowed to remain for a
few hours, when the frames are lifted out and the cakes
dried.</p>

<p>By this method glue may be bleached to such an extent
as to render it fit as a substitute for gelatine for many purposes,
for instance, for the imitation of thin plates of ivory.</p>

<p>Dr. Bruno Terne’s apparatus (Fig. 40), previously described,
may also be used for the generation of sulphurous
acid for bleaching purposes.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />

<small>DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF GLUE AND THEIR PREPARATION.</small></h3>


<p>Besides the broadly-distinguished forms of skin-and
bone-glue, the trade recognizes a large number of varieties,
distinguished either by their value or their fitness for special
purposes.</p>

<p><i>Joiner’s Glue.</i>—This variety is without doubt the oldest
in use and most in demand, and its principal requisite is
its great adhesive power. It is used for joining wood,
leather, paper, etc., and varies very much in quality and
price.</p>

<p>The best variety is prepared from scraps of hide and
skin. A light color not being especially demanded, there
existing rather a prejudice in favor of a dark-colored article,
waste of cattle and horse skins and tendons can be used for
its manufacture.</p>

<p>Joiner’s glue, which is generally preferred in thin cakes,
is chiefly manufactured in regular glue factories, though to
be able to compete with the bone-glue turned out by the
large establishments, the glue-boiler generally mixes skin
and bone-glue, and is thus enabled to turn out a tolerably
good quality. The price paid for the different varieties of
joiner’s glue varies very much, being generally higher in
winter than in summer, and is frequently more regulated
by the external appearance of the article than by its actual
value. Glue without gloss, very much warped and of a
very dark color, may, notwithstanding its faulty appearance,
possess excellent qualities.</p>

<p>Nothing need be said about the manufacture of joiner’s
glue, since what has been said about the manufacture of
glue in general suffices for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<p><i>How to make and use glue.</i> Break the glue into small
pieces, put it into an iron kettle, cover it with water, and
allow it to soak twelve hours; after soaking boil until done.
Then pour into a box which can be covered air-tight; leave
the cover off until cold, then cover up tight. As glue is
required, cut out a portion and melt in the usual way.
Expose no more of the made glue to the atmosphere for any
length of time than is necessary, as the atmosphere is very
destructive to made glue.</p>

<p>All glue, as received from the factory, requires the addition
of water before it will melt properly, and every addition
of water (while the glue is fresh made) will, up to a certain
point, increase its adhesiveness and elasticity. Some glues
will bear more water than others, but all will bear more
water than usually falls to their share, and that, too, with a
greater improvement in the quality of the work. For glue
to be properly effective, it requires to penetrate the pores of
the wood, and the more a body of glue penetrates the wood
the more substantial the joint will remain. Glues that take
the longest to dry are to be preferred to those that dry
quickly, the slow-drying glues being always the strongest,
other things being equal. Never heat made glue
in a pot that is subjected to the direct heat of the fire
or a lamp. All such methods of heating glue cannot
be condemned in terms too strong. Do not use thick glue
for joints or veneering. In all cases work it well into the
wood in a manner similar to what painters do with paint.
Glue both surfaces of your work excepting in the case of
veneering. Never glue upon hot wood, as it will absorb all
the water in the glue too suddenly, and leave only a very
little residue, with no adhesiveness in it whatever.</p>

<p><i>Holding power of glue.</i> 1. Glue exerts a far greater hold
on surfaces of wood cut across the grain than on those that
have been split, or cut with the grain.</p>

<p>2. When two surfaces of split wood are laid together, the
hold of the glue is the same whether the fibres are laid parallel
or crosswise to each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

<p>3. The holding power of glue on different woods estimated
in kilogrammes per square centimeter (0.155 square
inch) is as follows:</p>

<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p><i>Cologne glue.</i> The variety of glue known under this
name is prepared from selected scraps of hide and skin, and
is consequently very pure, and possesses great adhesive
power. It is of a light-brown color, and comes into commerce
in short thick cakes of great hardness. It is an
excellent quality of glue, and is preferred to all others by
bookbinders, workers in leather, etc. There are many
imitations of this variety, bone-glue being frequently sold
as Cologne glue.</p>

<p>The genuine article is manufactured from refuse of hide,
which, after liming, is carefully bleached in a bath of
chloride of lime, the concentration of which depends on the
darker or lighter color of the glue-stock. For 220 lbs. of
glue-stock, it is generally customary to use 1 lb. of chloride
of lime mixed with sufficient water to cover the stock.</p>

<p>After thorough impregnation of the glue-stock, which
generally requires about half an hour, add sufficient hydrochloric
acid to impart an acid taste to the bath of chloride
of lime. To be able to mix the mass thoroughly, it is best
to use a vat provided with a stirring apparatus. After
allowing the acid to act for a quarter of an hour, remove
every trace of it by careful washing.</p>

<p>To obtain a jelly as clear as possible, the gelatinous liquor
is drawn off as soon as the thin portions of the glue-stock
and the outside of the thicker ones are dissolved, they being
more thoroughly bleached than the rest. The residue is
worked into darker glue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p><i>Russian glue.</i> This variety is of a dirty white color, and,
like Cologne glue, is brought into commerce in short, thick
cakes. Its color and opaqueness are imparted to it by an
addition of 4 to 8 per cent. of white lead, chalk, zinc white,
or permanent white (sulphate of baryta). It has been
claimed that the superior adhesive power of Russian glue
is due to this addition of mineral substances, but the results
of many experiments fail to substantiate this claim. In
case the glue turns out turbid, it may be of advantage to
make it opaque by an addition of coloring matter, but the
quality of the glue remains unchanged. The best time to
add the coloring matter is shortly before drawing the glue-liquor
from the clarifying vats into the cooling boxes, as
the jelly is then of sufficient consistency to prevent the
substances from settling on the bottom. Skin-glue, as well
as bone-glue, is sold under the name of Russian glue.</p>

<p>Quite a considerable quantity of Russian glue brought
into commerce in the form of brownish-white sheets is prepared
from bones, the latter being degreased by boiling,
steaming or extraction, and the solution of the mineral constituents
effected by means of hydrochloric acid. The treatment
with acid is, however, continued only till the bones
commence to become soft and flexible. The solution of
phosphates is then drawn off, and the softened bones are
washed and in the usual manner worked to glue.</p>

<p>By this incomplete treatment with hydrochloric acid, a
certain quantity of the phosphates remains in the cartilage
and is inclosed in the glue prepared from it, the finished
product acquiring thereby a dirty whitish color, which is
by many considered an evidence of its quality. This
mechanical admixture of phosphates, however, does not
affect the adhesive power of the glue, neither increasing or
decreasing it. Such white and opaque glue is manufactured
to answer the demand in certain quarters of the trade, and,
as above mentioned, heavy white substances are often intentionally
incorporated with skin glue, as well as bone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
glue, to give it the appearance of Russian glue. These
heavy powders add to the weight of the product, though
when incorporated with it in small quantities do not injure
its adhesive power, but large quantities render the product
weaker.</p>

<p><i>Patent glue.</i> This term is applied to an indefinite number
of preparations, but particularly refers to a very pure
variety of bone glue of a deep dark-brown color not showing
net marks. It is very glossy, and swells up much in water.
To satisfy the demand for thick cakes, they must be cut
from very concentrated jelly to insure their drying.</p>

<p><i>Gilder’s glue</i> is found in commerce in very thin, pale
yellow cakes tied up in packages weighing about 2 lbs.
each. It is a variety of skin glue bleached with chloride of
lime, and dissolves with difficulty in water. The first runnings
from the boiler are used for its manufacture.</p>

<p>A very superior article of gilder’s glue is obtained by
cutting rabbit skins into fine shreds and boiling in water,
then turning the mixture into a basket through which the
liquid passes, leaving the refuse behind. About 100
grammes (3.52 ozs.) of sulphate of zinc and 20 grammes
(0.705 oz.) of alum are then separately dissolved in pure
boiling water and poured into the first-mentioned liquid,
and the whole well stirred together while hot. The mixture
is then passed through a sieve into a rectangular box,
in which the jelly remains twenty-four hours in winter, or
forty-eight in summer. The solid mass is taken from the
box, cut into slices of proper thickness, and dried upon nets.</p>

<p><i>Size glue and parchment glue</i> are manufactured in the same
manner. Both are skin-glues, and can be readily produced
by following the directions given for the manufacture
of skin-glue.</p>

<p><i>Paris glue</i> is used for sizing. It is brown, opaque, and
almost always soft. Being very hygroscopic, and imparting
a suitable flexibility to the felt, it is better adapted for
hatter’s use than any other variety. For its manufacture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
only the generative organs, or the thick tendons of the legs
of cattle and horses, are used, or other waste and fleshy
parts, and substances mixed with small bones, which, if
thoroughly cleansed, might yield a good quality of glue,
but are intentionally transformed by too long-continued
boiling, whereby the gelatinous solution is largely deprived
of its adhesive power, and yields a hygroscopic product.</p>

<p><i>Liquid Glues.</i> These are chiefly combinations of glue
with some ingredients added to destroy the gelatinizing
property and yet not impair its adhesiveness. They remain
for a long time clear and syrupy, and are used for a variety
of purposes. Below are given a few receipts for such glues.</p>

<p>1. Dissolve 38 parts of glue in small pieces in 100 parts
of acetic acid. Solution is promoted by exposing the vessel
to the sun or placing it in hot water.</p>

<p>2. Dissolve 50 parts of light-colored glue in 50 parts by
weight of hot water, in which 14 parts of fused magnesium
chloride have been dissolved. The solution on cooling
does not gelatinize, but remains syrupy, the density varying
according to the quantity of water used. In the preparation
of printing inks it can be used as a substitute for gum.</p>

<p>3. Dilute 10 parts of strong phosphoric acid with an
equal weight of water, and then gradually add 4 parts of
ammonium carbonate in the dry state. When the effervescence
has subsided, add a further 5 parts of water and warm
on the water-bath or steam-chest to 158° F. Now add 20
to 40 parts of glue, according to the consistency required,
and stir until all is dissolved. Cool.</p>

<p>4. Dissolve 20 parts of glue in an equal weight of hot
water, then cautiously pour in, stirring constantly, 4 parts
of strong nitric acid, warm until the nitrous fumes have
been driven off, filter, if necessary, through fine shavings,
and allow to cool.</p>

<p>5. Dissolve 3 parts of glue in small pieces in 12 to 15 parts
of saccharate of lime. By heating, the glue dissolves rapidly
and remains liquid, when cold, without loss of adhesive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
power. Any desirable consistency can be secured by varying
the amount of saccharate of lime. Thick glue retains
its muddy color, while a thin solution becomes clear on
standing.</p>

<p>The saccharate of lime is prepared by dissolving 1 part
of loaf sugar in 3 parts of water, and after adding one-fourth
part of the weight of sugar of slaked lime, heating the whole
to between 149° and 185° F., and allowing it to macerate
for several days, shaking it frequently. The solution, which
has the properties of mucilage, is then decanted from the
sediment.</p>

<p>The solution of the glue in saccharate of lime is readily
accomplished, even old gelatine, which has become insoluble
in water, dissolving without difficulty. This variety of
liquid glue possesses great adhesive power, and admits of
many uses.</p>

<p>6. Dissolve 8 parts of glue in 16 parts of hot water, then
add ½ to 1 part of hydrochloric acid, and 1½ parts of sulphate
of zinc. Keep the mixture for 8 hours at 158° F.,
then filter through fine shavings, and allow to cool.</p>

<p><i>Steam glue.</i> Under this name several varieties of liquid
glue are brought into commerce. They are prepared as
follows:—</p>

<p>1. <i>Russian steam-glue.</i> 100 parts of a good quality of
glue, 100 to 110 parts of warm water, and 5.5 to 6 parts of
commercial nitric acid of 36° B.</p>

<p>2. <i>Pale steam-glue.</i> 100 parts of glue, 200 of water, and
12 of nitric acid of 36° B.</p>

<p>3. <i>Dark steam-glue.</i> 100 parts of glue, 140 of water, and
16 of nitric acid of 36° B.</p>

<p>Soak the glue in cold water, then pour the necessary
quantity of warm water over it, and heat gently on a water-bath
until all the glue is dissolved. Next add gradually
the nitric acid with constant stirring, and to the Russian
steam-glue 6 parts of finely pulverized sulphate of lead,
which will impart to it the white color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

<p><i>Chrome glue.</i> This preparation is very permanent and
durable. To prepare it add to a moderately concentrated
solution of 5 parts of glue 1 of dissolved acid chromate of
lime, this salt being considered better for the purpose than
the bichromate of potash usually used. The glue thus
prepared becomes, after exposure to the light, insoluble in
water in consequence of a partial reduction of the chromic
acid. This preparation can be used for cementing glass
articles, liable to be exposed to boiling water, the treatment
being the ordinary one of applying the glue to both surfaces
of the fractured object, and then binding them together
until dry, and exposing them for a sufficient length
of time to the light, after which boiling water will have no
effect upon them. It is suggested that this preparation is
better adapted to cementing the covers on glass slides than
any now in use. The same preparation can be applied for
making fabrics water-proof, especially sails, awnings, etc.,
where no great flexibility is required. Two or three applications
of the glue, either by immersion of the object in it,
or by the use of the brush, will answer the purpose. Roofing
paper is also rendered impervious, even when exposed
to long-continued rains.</p>

<p><i>Glue for attaching leather to metal.</i> A method of affixing
leather to metal, so that it will split before it can be torn
off, consists in digesting a quantity of nutgalls, reduced to
powder, in eight parts of distilled water for six hours, and
filtering it through a cloth; then dissolving one part by
weight of glue in the same quantity of water, and allowing
it to remain twenty-four hours. The leather is moistened
with the decoction of nutgalls and the solution of glue
applied to the metal, previously roughened and heated.
The leather is then laid upon it, and dried under pressure.</p>

<p><i>Glue for leather, paper, etc.</i> The following process affords
an unusually adhesive paste, adapted to fastening leather,
paper, etc., without the defects of glue, and if preserved
from evaporation in closed bottles will keep for years.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
Cover 4 parts, by weight, of glue with 15 parts of cold
water, and allow it to soak for several hours; then warm
moderately till the solution is perfectly clear, and dilute it
with 65 parts of boiling water, intimately stirred in. Next
prepare a solution of 30 parts of starch in 200 of cold water,
so as to form a thin homogeneous liquid free from lumps,
and pour the boiling glue solution into it with thorough
stirring, and at the same time keeping the mass boiling.</p>

<p><i>Glue for parchment paper in making sausage skins.</i> The
supply of intestines soon being exhausted by the enormous
quantity of pease-sausages manufactured for the German
army during the Franco-German war, the necessity arose
for a substitute. This consisted of a tube of parchment
glued together. Millions of these tubes from Dr. Jacobsen’s
factory were tested by the government, and found to answer
the purpose admirably. They were even boiled for hours
without either the glued seam or the paper itself being injured
by the operation. The secret of the composition of
the glue employed for fastening the parchment paper seems
to be well kept, but the one given in the following is equal
to it in all respects, if not indeed identical: Add to one
quart of a good adhesive solution of glue ¾ to 1 oz. of finely
powdered bichromate of potash. Warm the mixture slightly
on a water-bath when about to use it, and before applying
it moisten the parchment paper. The latter, when glued
with this preparation, as in the formation of the small
cylinders for sausages, must be rapidly dried on a hurdle,
and then exposed to the light until the yellow glue becomes
brownish. The cylinders are then slowly boiled in
a sufficient quantity of water to which two or three per
cent. of alum has been added, until all the chromate is dissolved
out, and they are then washed in cold water and
dried, and will look very inviting, especially if white glue
has been used. A similar result may be reached by using
a concentrated solution of cellulose in ammoniacal oxide of
copper. Thus if cylinders of unsized paper are formed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
this paste, and when thoroughly dry drawn through a
parchmentizing solution (a cooled mixture of 2 volumes of
fuming sulphuric acid and 1 volume of water), they will be
beautifully parchmentized, and after the neutralization of
the acid, washing, etc., it will present a striking resemblance
to natural intestines.</p>

<p><i>Tungstic glue.</i> This preparation offers an acceptable substitute
for hard India rubber. It is made by mixing a
thick solution of glue with tungstate of soda and hydrochloric
acid, by means of which a compound of tungstic
acid and glue is precipitated, which, at a temperature of
86° to 104° F., is sufficiently elastic to admit of being
drawn out into very thin sheets. On cooling, this mass
becomes solid and brittle, and on being heated is again soft
and plastic. It can be used for all purposes to which hard
rubber is adapted.</p>

<p><i>Indestructible mass for the manufacture of ornaments, toys,
etc.</i> A mass, which is to have the hardness of horn, consists
of 50 parts of glue, 35 of wax or rosin, 15 of glycerine
and the required quantity of a metallic oxide, or mineral
color. A soft mass consists of about 50 parts of glue, 25 of
wax or rosin, and 25 of glycerine. The glue is melted in
the glycerine with the assistance of steam, and the wax or
rosin added. The latter in melting mixes with the glue
and glycerine, and finally the mineral color is added. The
mass is poured in a liquid state into moulds of plaster of
Paris, wood, or metal. The degree of hardness of the mass
is increased by an addition of 30 to 35 per cent. of zinc
white, or other mineral color, according to the color the
article is to have.</p>

<p><i>Compound for billiard balls.</i> Allow 80 parts of Russian
glue and 10 parts of Cologne glue to swell up in 10 parts
of water; then heat over a water-bath, and when dissolved,
add 5 parts of heavy spar, 4 parts of chalk and 1 part of
boiled linseed oil. Of a portion of the mass form small
sticks, dip them in the remainder, and allow the adherent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
portion to dry, and repeat this process until a crude ball
has been formed. This is placed in a dry room for three
or four months, and when thoroughly dry, it is turned.
The finished ball is placed in a bath of sulphate of alumina
for one hour, dried, and polished like an ivory ball.</p>

<p><i>Coloring glue.</i> Common black or dark glue, while
possessing all the adhesive and other essential qualities of
fine colored glue, has heretofore, owing to its color, been
confined in its use to such purposes in the arts where color
was not essential.</p>

<p>The object of the following process, which is the invention
of G. J. Lesser, of Frankfort, Germany, is to color such
glue so that it is both refined and tinted, and may be used
for various purposes in the arts. It is especially applicable
in the manufacture of sizing and finishing compounds for
paper hangings, compounds for the manufacture of elastic
rolls, for glue and size compounds for finishing yarns,
textile fabrics of silk, cotton, etc., for the manufacture of
calcimines and wall-coverings, for glue to be used with
colored woods, and for all other purposes where a fine,
strong-colored glue is required.</p>

<p>For coloring common black or dark glue take a pound
and a half of liquid extract of lead and mix it into the
water in which the glue has been soaked, as follows: Thirteen
pounds of glue, sixty-three and a quarter pounds of
water. Allow the glue to soak for about twenty-four hours,
then dilute it by a slow fire, and when heated gradually
pour in one and a half pounds of the extract of lead and
mix it well together.</p>

<p>The extract of lead is a well-known commercial article,
and it is well suited for this purpose; but the inventor does
not limit himself to this particular preparation, as there are
a larger number of neutral and basic compounds of lead
that may be so modified as to produce results similar, if not
identical, with the results obtained by the formula above
given. Gelatine may be treated instead of glue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<p><i>Compositions for printing rollers.</i> All such compositions
contain gelatine or glue. The following receipts are used:</p>

<p>A patent roller composition is thus made: Gelatine 32
lbs. and glue 4 lbs. are softened in cold water and melted
in a glue boiler. To this are added 4 lbs. of glucose, 72 lbs.
of glycerine, and 1 oz. of methylated spirit. The whole is
then digested for four to six hours and cast into rollers.
This composition is claimed to be unaffected by temperature,
to retain its elasticity, and not to shrink.</p>

<p>In practice it is found that all these compositions from
the cleansing and remelting become gradually sticky and
useless. To partially overcome this difficulty, formaldehyde
is added to the roller composition, which renders the glue
insoluble in water, and thus prolongs the life of the roller.</p>

<p><i>Size.</i> This product is simply an undried glue and is
used, not for adhesiveness, but as a body for filling porous
surfaces, such as wood or plaster, stiffening and weighting
textile fabrics, in paper manufacture, and as a foundation
for oil paints and varnishes. According to Thomas Lambert,
many firms who have a good selling connection for
size, do not go to the expense of erecting clarifying plant
and drying house for treating the glue-liquors, but prefer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
to stop the process half way, as it were, and marketing the
resulting product as size. Others, again, with a complete
glue plant at hand, convert only a portion of their liquors
into size, to meet trade demands, the bulk going for the
manufacture of glue. Size varies in quality to suit the
requirements of different trades. Cardboard box-makers
prefer a strong skin size, which is manufactured red or
yellow as preferred. A strong yellow size made from bone
is used by calico-printers, paper-stainers, wall-paper manufacturers,
and in the straw-hat and carpet trades.</p>

<p>In the preparation of skin-glue, the first and second
liquors are used for that purpose; the residual mass is then
treated with water and steam, which practically exhausts
the gelatinous matter. This, the third liquor, is used solely
for size. During the boiling, samples are taken at intervals,
cooled, and the condition of the jelly noted. The strength
is also taken by the glue meter, which registers the percentage.
At a strength of 8 to 10 per cent. the liquor is run
off, passing through a filter of fine shavings or cloth, to
remove any suspended matter, into a wooden vat fitted
with a steam coil, then heated with a moderate charge of
sulphurous acid to bring up the color, and evaporated to a
strength of 36 to 38 per cent., as may be desired, and then
run into casks to jelly. If skin-glue is not made, the three
runnings are used entirely for size.</p>

<p>An outline of a simple process used in an English factory
devoted to making tub-size, as given by Samuel Rideal,
may be interesting.</p>

<p>The material is obtained from the tanyard ready limed
and freed from hair, and consists mainly of “faces” of
bullocks or cows, the noses being cut off as food for dogs.
It is soaked again in weak lime water and re-washed, then
placed in coppers made of wrought-iron wielded in one
piece, and holding about 10 to 20 gallons, enclosed in outer
jackets of the same material containing water which is kept
well boiling. There are six coppers, about five feet high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
by three feet in diameter. The charge of each is about ½
cwt. The material is covered with water and well stirred
with sticks for two hours, the scum and dross being occasionally
skimmed off and thrown away as useless. At the
end the size is ladled on to sieves, from which it runs into
cooling vats, and is filled while moderately hot into clean
tubs.</p>

<p>The liquor is clear and of a light brown color for the
best XX quality, and darker for the common. The coolers
or setting-backs are of wood or zinc, and the liquid is not
kept hot longer than it can be helped, as it is liable to turn
sour.</p>

<p>Bone-size is, according to Thomas Lambert, prepared as
follows: The bones are first degreased by the naphtha process,
and then passed through the cleanser direct into the
glue-boilers and steamed, as in the manufacture of glue.
The resulting liquors are forced up to the clarifying vats
and partially bleached with a current of sulphurous acid,
passing through bag-filters to the evaporating troughs, and
concentrated from 30 to 38 per cent., as required, and then
jellied in casks.</p>

<p>The manufacturer with no benzine or glue plant at his
disposal washes the bones in a revolving drum, and, after
crushing, they are fed into a boiler and subjected to an
alternate current of steam and water, the latter coming
from a spray pipe fixed at the top of the boiler. The
liquors are generally drawn in two portions, having a
strength of 14 to 16 per cent. of glue. After separating the
fat, which is refined and sold to the soap-maker, the liquors
are run into a large wooden vat about 8 × 6 × 4 feet, fitted
with a steam coil, partly bleached with liquid sulphurous
acid, and then boiled down to the required strength.</p>

<p>For a common size the bones are crushed but unwashed,
and are fed direct into the boiler and treated as above. The
liquors are not bleached, and boiled to a strength of about
25 per cent. glue. The composition of the different grades
may be given as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

<p>
Common size. 25 per cent. glue, 75 per cent. water, etc.<br />
Medium size. 30 per cent. glue, 70 per cent. water.<br />
Best size. 38 per cent. glue, 62 per cent. water.<br />
</p>

<p>A concentrated size is now prepared by many manufacturers.
It is a bone-size, and is sold at a Baumé strength
at 122° C.</p>

<p>
No. 1. 15° Bé. at 122° C., 40.5 per cent. glue.<br />
No. 2. 20° Bé. at 122° C., 44.5 per cent. glue.<br />
No. 3. 25° Bé. at 122° C., 49 per cent. glue.<br />
</p>

<p>Under the name of concentrated size also are sold a
series of powdered glues of different qualities. They are
the off-color and twisted cakes, sorted out in the warehouse,
and ground to a fine condition by passing through a mill,
and their value is based on the quality of the cake ground.</p>

<p>Size rapidly ferments and becomes sour and mouldy
unless some preservative is added. Sulphate of zinc is
mainly used for this purpose.</p>

<p><i>Bookbinders’ Size.</i>—I. Water, 2 quarts; powdered alum,
1 oz.; Russian isinglass, 2 ozs.; curd soap, 40 grains. Simmer
one hour, strain through linen or a fine sieve, and use
while warm.</p>

<p>II. Water, 2 gallons; best glue, 1 lb.; alum, 4 ozs.
Prepare and use as above.</p>

<p>III. Water, 2 quarts; isinglass, 5 ozs.; alum, 240 grains.</p>

<p><i>Water-proof Glue.</i>—Solution of glue by itself or mixed with
pigments is used in painting walls in distemper. A water-proof
coat is obtained as follows: Boil 1 part of powdered
gall-nuts and 12 parts of water until the mass is reduced to
two-thirds of its bulk. Then strain through a cloth and
apply the solution to the dry coat of distemper paint, the
latter becoming thereby as solid and insoluble as oil-paint.
The tannin of the gall-nuts acting only upon soft glue, the
solution has to be applied so the lower layer of glue becomes
thoroughly soaked through.</p>

<p>To render <i>wrapping paper</i> water-proof the following glue-solution
may be used: Dissolve 24 parts of alum and 4<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
parts of white soap in 32 parts of water in one pot, and in
another 2 parts of gum arabic and 6 parts of glue in 32
parts of water, and mix the two solutions. Heat the mixture,
immerse the wrapping paper in it, and pass it through
hot rolls, or dry upon twine stretched in frames.</p>

<p><i>Fabrics may be rendered water-proof</i> with glue and tannin.
The process is based on the fact that by the action of tannin
or bichromates, compounds insoluble in water are formed.
It is, however, of first importance that both solutions—tannin
and glue—should fully penetrate the fabric. If the
latter is dipped directly into strong solution of glue and
then of tannin, the glue will only become insoluble on the
outside, and that which has penetrated deeper into the
fibre will be unchanged, having been protected by the
superficial insoluble layer. Hence, the treatment is commenced
with a very weak solution of glue, prepared by
leaving glue broken small in hundred times its weight of
water for twenty-four hours. By that time the glue will
have swelled up, and the whole is boiled, whilst being constantly
stirred, so as to get a perfectly clear solution in
which the fabric is boiled for 10 to 15 minutes. This time
is no more than necessary for complete penetration. The
fabric is then well wrung between two rollers placed over
the glue-bath so that excess of solution runs back into it.
The fabric is then hung up, and when nearly dry is passed
through a tannin solution. The latter may be made from
tannin itself, or from a tannin extract, or by boiling galls
or oak bark in water. The tannin solution can be used
fairly strong, as only so much of it is taken up as corresponds
to the glue present, and it can be used over again as
long as it can supply the tannin required, and can then be
reinforced with more tannin as required.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for the fabric to stay long in the
tannin, as it reacts quickly with the glue. The tanned
material is again hung up to dry, and when quite dry is
washed in plain water to remove any excess of tannin. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
whole process from the beginning is then twice repeated.
After this second repetition there is so thick a layer of tannate
of gelatine on the fabric that the dry cloth has
acquired considerable solidity and a smoothness which
recalls that of leather. The fabric is now passed through a
stronger glue solution, using three or even four parts of
glue per hundred of water, but never exceeding the latter
limit. After the glue-bath the fabric goes through the
tannin bath, whereby it becomes quite thickly coated with
tannate of gelatine. By repeatedly treating with glue and
tannin alternately, this coating can be made as thick as
desired, and finally masses are obtained in which the
texture of the fabric is entirely hidden, and especially after
the fabric has been calendered under heavy pressure after
water-proofing. The color acquired by goods thus water-proofed
is a more or less dark leather-brown.</p>

<p>Muratori and Landry treat the fabric with a solution
made in three separate operations:</p>

<p>1. Potash alum 100 lbs. dissolved in 10 gallons of boiling
water.</p>

<p>2. In another vessel 100 lbs. of glue are soaked in cold
water till the glue has trebled in weight. The remaining
water is poured off, and the glue liquefied by the application
of heat. When the glue is boiling, 5 lbs. of tannin and
2 lbs. of soda water glass are put in it.</p>

<p>3. The two solutions are boiled together, being stirred
constantly.</p>

<p>When the mixture is complete, it is allowed to cool to a
jelly. To water-proof the goods some of the jelly is boiled
with water (1 gallon to 1 lb., or a little over) for three
hours, adding water to compensate for evaporation, so as to
keep the volume of the solution constant, as shown by tests
of its specific gravity with a hydrometer. The bath is then
allowed to cool to 176° F., and the fabric is soaked in it for
half an hour and then stretched out horizontally for six
hours to drain. The fabric must be kept horizontal, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
the solution remains uniformly distributed through it. The
drainings are collected to be used over again. The fabric
is then dried in the open air or in a drying room, still in
the horizontal position. If a drying room is used the temperature
of it should not exceed 122° F.</p>

<p>Muzmann and Krakowitzer dissolve 10 lbs. of gelatine
and 10 lbs. of tallow soap in 30 gallons of boiling water,
and mix the solution in 4 gallons of water in which 15 lbs.
of alum have been dissolved. The whole is boiled for half
an hour, and then allowed to cool to 104° F. At that
temperature the fabric is thoroughly soaked in it, dried,
rinsed, again dried, and finally calendered. In this process
the alum partially decomposes the soap, forming either
free fatty acid or an acid alumina soap. The gelatine forms
an insoluble compound with the alum. The free fatty acid
or acid soap is mostly carried down on the fibre by the precipitate
formed by the alum and the gelatine.</p>

<p><i>Glue for Joints in Leather Driving Belts.</i>—Soak equal parts
of good hide glue and isinglass in water for 10 hours, and
then boil with pure tannin till the product becomes sticky.
The surfaces to be cemented together should be roughened
and the glue applied hot.</p>

<p>According to another method 2 lbs. of best glue are dissolved
at a moderate heat in 3 lbs. of water and about 3
drachms of carbolic acid stirred into the hot solution. The
mixture is poured into shallow iron pans to congeal, when
it is cut in pieces and dried in the air. For use the glue is
liquefied by adding a small quantity of vinegar and applied
with a brush to the leather. The joint is finally pressed
between iron plates at a temperature of about 77° F.</p>

<p><i>Hectograph Mass.</i>—Soak a good quality of glue for 24
hours in sufficient cold water to cover it. Then take the
swelled glue from the water and melt it in an enameled pot
over a moderate fire. When perfectly liquid add the required
quantity of glycerine (see formulas below) and intimately
mix both by continued stirring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>

<p>The vessel containing the mixture should for some time
be kept hot, so that the mass remains thinly fluid. The
purpose of this is to allow the air-bubbles formed by stirring
to rise to the surface. If any scum is formed on the surface,
remove it carefully with a shallow spoon. The composition
is then ready to be poured into the vessel intended
for its reception, which may be made especially for the
purpose, or a shallow baking pan of tin may be used.
When the pan is filled with the composition place it perfectly
level in a cool place free from dust and allow to
remain at least for several hours.</p>

<p><i>Formulas for Hectograph Masses.</i>—I. Gilder’s glue, 100
parts; glycerine of 28° Bé., 500.</p>

<p>The glue is allowed to swell in water, as described above,
then melted, mixed with the glycerine, and evaporated to
the required consistency.</p>

<small>MANUFACTURE OF GELATINE, AND PRODUCTS PREPARED
FROM IT.</small></h3>


<p>Gelatine, like glue, is produced from hides and skins,
and bones. It is distinguished by its purity, has a slight
yellowish tint, and is very hard and elastic. In cold water
it softens, swells up, becomes opaque, but does not dissolve.
In hot water it dissolves completely, and on cooling for
several hours, an almost colorless, transparent and very
firm jelly results. This property of becoming jellied is in
part lost if the solution is for some time exposed to a temperature
higher than 212° F.</p>

<p>The chemical constitution of gelatine is entirely changed
by concentrated sulphuric or nitric acid. Concentrated
acetic acid, on the other hand, renders softened gelatine
transparent, and then dissolves it; the solution does not become
viscid, but preserves its adhesive property. Dilute
acids have no appreciable effect either on the coagulating
or the adhesive power.</p>

<p>Tannin is a valuable and delicate test of the presence of
gelatine. When added to a solution containing only
1/5000th part of gelatine, nebulosity is immediately apparent.
When more concentrated gelatinous liquors are treated with
tincture or infusion of nut gall, a dense, white, caseous subsidence
occurs which, on desiccation, becomes brownish-yellow,
agglutinates, and forms a hard, brittle mass easily
reduced to powder.</p>

<p>Gelatine is much used for culinary and medicinal purposes,
and for fining beer, wine and other liquids. Considered
medicinally, it is emollient and demulcent, and for
this end is dissolved in water or milk, and rendered pala<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>table
by the addition of acid and sugar. In pharmacy, it
is used for the formation of capsules intended to conceal the
nauseous odor and taste of medicinal preparations inclosed
in them. It is likewise employed for coating pills.</p>


<h4>SKIN GELATINE.</h4>

<p>But few changes have been made in the process of manufacturing
skin gelatine since the method introduced and
patented, in 1839, by George Nelson. This patent relates
to the preparation of a transparent gelatine from waste of
calf skins, and of an inferior variety from other skins freed
from hair, wool, and fleshy and fatty matters. The mode
of procedure is the same in both cases, and is as follows:
The cuttings being washed are macerated in solution of
caustic soda or caustic potash at a temperature of 60° F.,
until they are partially softened. Ten days is the average
period required to effect this. They are then placed in
closed vessels and permitted to remain until a thorough
softening is effected. They are now washed in a revolving
cylinder, through which a current of water passes to free
them from adhering alkali; exposed in a well-closed chamber
to the action of sulphurous acid, and finally submitted to
pressure to remove the adhering water. The softened mass
bleached by sulphurous acid is then placed in a suitable
vessel and subjected to the action of steam until it is, as
far as possible, dissolved. The liquor is then strained and
set aside at a temperature of 100° to 120° F. for the impurities
which may have remained to subside. The clarified
solution is poured upon slabs of slate or marble to the
depth of about half an inch and allowed to remain there till
sufficiently solidified, when it is cut, and washed to remove
all traces of acid. It is subsequently redissolved by means
of a steam bath at a temperature of 95° F., finally again
solidified, and dried by exposure to dry air upon nets.</p>

<p>Messrs. J. and G. Cox, of Edinburgh, patented in 1844, a
process by which a perfectly pure substance, superior to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
that prepared from isinglass is obtained. Shoulders and
cheeks of ox-hides are preferred by the patentees. They
are thoroughly cleansed in water, after which they are cut
into pieces by a machine similar to that used for cutting
straw, and then subjected to the action of a paper-maker’s
pulp-mill. By this process the gelatinous fibre is well
washed and cleansed, as a stream of water flows through
the mill during the whole operation, carrying off all the
impurities. The comminuted material is next pressed between
rolls, mixed with fresh water, sufficient to effect its
solution, and heated to a temperature varying from 150° to
212° F. The resulting gelatine-solution is then allowed to
cool to 150° F., and mixed with fresh bullock’s blood—1
part of the latter to 700 parts of solution. At a somewhat
increased temperature the albumen of the blood coagulates
and rises in the form of foam to the surface, or subsides in
the shape of flakes, carrying with it the impurities, and
thus clarifying the liquor. The latter is allowed to stand
for some time, when it is poured upon stone slabs and
allowed to solidify.</p>

<p>G. P. Swinborne’s improved patented process for the
preparation of gelatine from hides, skins and glue pieces,
relates mainly to the cleansing of the raw material. The
latter is reduced by means of suitable instruments to shavings
or slices, and soaked in cold water, which is drained
off and replaced by fresh water three times a day, until no
odor or taste is perceptible. The shavings are then heated
with water, not above boiling, strained through filter cloths,
and the liquor is then run on to slate or other material
to dry.</p>

<p>The modern process of preparing skin gelatine is, according
to Thomas Lambert, carried out as follows: The first
treatment the cleansed skins undergo is the “steeping”
process with caustic soda or milk of lime. In some factories
a mixture of caustic (slaked) lime and soda ash is
used, in the proportion of 6 lbs. soda ash and 6 lbs. slaked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
lime to every hundred-weight of skins treated, the chemical
change being that the whole of the carbonate of soda (soda
ash) is converted into caustic soda by its equivalent of
caustic lime, the excess of the latter remaining as such.
The equation representing this is—</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
<td class="ct">Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub><br /><small>Soda ash.</small></td>

<td class="ct">+</td>
<td class="ct">CaCO<sub>3</sub><br /><small>Carbonate of lime.</small></td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>This steeping is conducted in large wooden vats, each
having a length of 12 feet, width 8 feet, and depth 3 feet,
and fixed with a slight gradient to the overflow, which is
placed at the most convenient corner of the vat and protected
by perforated boards. The skins in the vat are
nearly covered with water, and then the solution of caustic
soda, or the slaked lime mixed in water to a cream, is
sprayed equally over the mass, the whole being intimately
mixed with long stirring poles. The water is renewed
twice during a period of 12 days, the time allowed for the
skins to soak. They are now removed to a chamber, in
which a moderate increase of heat facilitates the saponification
of the fat and the dissolving of the fleshy matter. The
chamber is a brick building, with a cemented floor, on
which the skins are spread to a uniform depth of about six
inches and is heated by steam pipes running round the building.
At a temperature of about 70° F. the skins are exposed
two or three days, with frequent turning. They are
now transferred to the washing machine and washed until
the effluent is practically free of soda or lime. The skins
then undergo a bleaching process to whiten, and thus destroy
any injurious coloring matter. For this purpose the
washed skins are removed to a number of vats fitted with
folding covers, and treated to a solution of sulphurous acid
of ½° Twaddell strength for 24 hours, each vat being well
stirred at intervals to allow the “bleach” to permeate
equally the mass.</p>

<p>In some factories this process is carried out with dry sul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>phurous
acid, the gas being generated in a sulphur burner
and, after washing, passed into a chamber containing the
skins. The vats are now drained, then filled up with
water, well stirred, and the water run off. This is repeated
until the effluent is practically free of any sulphurous smell,
and the work of dissolving the gelatine is proceeded with.
The digesting of the skins is carried on in stoutly built, circular
wooden vats, each having a size, generally of 4 feet 6
inches diameter and 6 feet deep, and fitted with 2¼ inch
copper steam coil. The vats are provided with a double
wooden bottom to divide the heat. They are arranged on
the first floor of the building, the liquors running through
a shallow filter of fine copper gauze to the clarifying vats
beneath. The skins are raised by an elevator and fed direct
into the vats by suitably-arranged troughs, then covered
with water, and steam is sent through the coils. The temperature
is frequently taken by the thermometer and should
never exceed 177° F. During the digestion, any unsaponified
fat and dirt comes to the surface as a scum, and is carefully
skimmed off from time to time. Samples are also
drawn of the liquors, cooled, and the appearance and
strength of the jelly noted. After five to six hours’ heating,
the first liquors are run off to the clarifying vats, at a
strength of about 17 per cent. gelatine.</p>

<p>The vats are refilled with water, and a second digestion
made, the liquor running to the clarifying vats at a strength
of 12 per cent. In the third digestion the temperature is
raised a few degrees to practically exhaust the gelatinous
matter, and can either be clarified to form an inferior gelatine,
or concentrated for size. The exhausted matter is taken
to the manure-shed for mixing purposes. The clarifying of
the first and second liquors—and if used for gelatine the
third liquor—is done separately in the clarifying vats. The
clearing agent used is alum, to the extent of ½ per cent., or
a little blood diluted with water; both are mixed with a
small portion of the hot liquors in a bucket, and then well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
stirred in the vats. The liquors are raised to 177° F. to
coagulate the impurities, and then lowered to 149° F. and
allowed to stand for two hours. During this time the
coagulated matter rises to the surface, and is skimmed off.
On leaving the vats, the liquors are filtered through fine
copper gauze into a receiver from which is fed the vacuum
pan.</p>

<p>Gelatinous liquors being peculiarly sensitive, especially
as regards color, to high temperatures, it is found advisable
to evaporate them in vacuo; and this method is adopted
by all continental makers. The three grades of the liquors,
concentrated to the required strength, are run on to squares
of glass, 4´ × 4´, fixed in a wood framing, to a depth of ½
inch for cake and ¼ inch for leaf gelatine, then placed
perfectly level on racks for jellying. In 24 hours the jelly
is firm, and can be easily cut to the desired size of cake or
leaf wanted. A very fine gelatine is produced by cutting
the jelly into small pieces, washing well with cold water,
and remelting at a temperature of 176° F., and poured
again on the glasses for jellying.</p>

<p>The drying is carried on by exposing the cut cakes, on
nets fixed to a framework of wood, to a rapid current of dry
air in the tunnels, as described in the drying of glue.</p>


<h4>BONE GELATINE.</h4>

<p>The materials used for this purpose should be of the best
description, the most suitable bones being calves’ feet, waste
of turners and button makers, the bony cores of the horns
of the ox and cow. Such bones do not require comminution,
but if large bones of oxen, horses, etc., are to be used, it is
recommended to break them as small as possible by means
of a wooden mallet, and to avoid the use of iron stampers,
as the bones become heated by the heavy blows and friction
to which they are subjected during the process, and acquire
an empyreumatic odor which is retained by the gelatine.</p>

<p>The next step in the process is the solution of the glue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
cartilage. This was formerly effected by the use of steam
and water. The crushed bones were placed in a wire
basket or cage and this inserted in a small cast-iron cylinder
and steam introduced. The apparatus is connected
with a steam boiler, and provided with an air-tight lid, and
a pipe and a rose connected with a water reservoir for pouring
water over the bones in order to promote the solution
of the glue cartilage. But this process is very slow, 20
hours being required without completely exhausting the
bones.</p>

<p>The resulting gelatinous liquor is drawn off every hour,
the first run, which contains the dirt and grease, being,
of course, kept separate from the rest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 59.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p171.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As will be readily understood this process consumes
much fuel, and leaves a residue which, though not completely
exhausted, cannot be further utilized for the preparation
of gelatine. In fact the entire process is obsolete,
but as it is still in use in some localities, a description is
here given, for the sake of completeness, of the apparatus
and improved manner of manufacture employed in the
factory of D. J. Briers, which is well known for the beautiful
product turned out.</p>

<p>Fig. 59 shows a longitudinal section of the entire apparatus.</p>

<p>Fig. 60 is the horizontal section of the boiler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

<p><i>a</i>, is the cylindrical boiler 6 meters (19.68 feet) long, and
2 meters (6.56 feet) in diameter. It is made of strong
boiler plate doubly riveted, and capable of resisting a pressure
of six or seven atmospheres.</p>

<p><i>b</i>, is the manhole. It is closed by an oval lid secured
by two iron rods and two bolts, so that after placing the lid
in position, the boiler is hermetically closed by tightening
the nuts upon the bolts.</p>

<p><i>c</i>, is a cast-iron fork with two safety valves with levers
graduated from 1 to 100 atmospheric degrees.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 60.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p172.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p><i>d</i>, is a float upon the surface of the water, and provided
with a wheel graduated from Nos. 1 to 6. Its object is to
indicate during the operation how much water is lost and
how much remains in the boiler. Care must be had not
to allow the indicator of the wheel to get below No. 1. This
figure indicates that the water has reached the highest point
in the boiler exposed to the fire, which is consequently the
lowest point which the water can be allowed to reach. On
the other hand the indicator must not move above No. 6, as
the water when standing too high in the boiler and too
close to the pipes conducting the steam into the various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
apparatuses might mix with the steam and spoil the operation
carried on in the drum, <i>e</i>, Fig. 60.</p>

<p><i>f</i>, Fig 60, is a manometer, which indicates the degrees of
pressure exerted by the steam in the interior of the boiler.
It consists of a wrought-iron pipe bent double, and is filled
with mercury 1.22 meter (4.002 feet) high counted from its
base. One end of the pipe communicates with the boiler,
while the other end is provided with a small brass wheel.
Upon the latter is a thread of twisted silk, to the end of
which is suspended an iron cylinder of somewhat smaller
circumference than the bore of the pipe, so that it can move
up and down in it without friction. This cylinder rests
always upon the mercury. To the other end of the thread
is fastened an indicator of somewhat less weight than the
cylinder, which, by sliding in a groove in a graduated
board placed alongside the pipe, indicates the degrees of
steam pressure.</p>

<p><i>g</i> is a cast-iron pipe for heating the drying room, and</p>

<p><i>h</i> another cast-iron pipe for heating the store-room for
the bones.</p>

<p><i>i</i> is the forcing pump for feeding the boiler with water.</p>

<p><i>k</i> is a sheet-iron reservoir placed close to the end of the
boiler. It is filled with water, which is heated by the heat
lost in the fire-place in consequence of the draught, and by
allowing the smoke to circulate under the reservoir before
passing into the chimney. The reservoir communicates
with the forcing-pump by means of a pipe and stopcock,
so as to avoid feeding the boiler with cold water.</p>

<p><i>l</i> is the fire-place, consisting of the grate, door and cast-iron
frame.</p>

<p>The drum, <i>e</i>, is a spherical vessel of strong sheet-iron
doubly riveted. It is 3 meters (9.84 feet) in diameter, and
capable of resisting a pressure of six to seven atmospheres.
It serves for softening the bones with the assistance of steam
passed into it from the boiler, <i>a</i>. It is provided with a
manhole similar to that of the boiler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<p><i>n</i> is a wrought-iron shaft passing horizontally through
the drum and revolving in the brasses, <i>o</i>.</p>

<p><i>g</i>, Fig. 61, is a gearing with a crank, by means of which
the drum <i>e</i> is revolved. The power of the gearing must be
so calculated that one man can turn the wheels when the
drum is filled with water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_p174.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 61.</span></div>
</div>

<p><i>r</i> is a false bottom perforated in its entire length with
holes 12 millimeters (0.47 inch) in diameter, and is placed
about 15 centimeters (5.9 inches) above the true bottom of
the drum. It consists of two pieces, and is secured by two
nuts, so that it can be easily removed and replaced. Its
object is to prevent the bones from clogging up the pipe <i>s</i>,
and the cocks <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>.</p>

<p><i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, Fig. 61, are angular iron points inside of the drum
<i>e</i>. Their object is to facilitate the shifting of the bones
when the drum is revolving.</p>

<p><i>x</i>, Fig. 59, is a cock near the manhole. It is opened
about 2 millimeters (0.079 inch) during the operation in
the drum. It serves also for the escape of the steam from
the drum when the operation is finished.</p>

<p>The cocks <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, placed in the lower part of the drum,
serve for the escape of steam condensed during the operation.</p>

<p>The steam pipe <i>p</i>, Fig. 59, conducts the steam from the
vessel <i>a</i> into the drum <i>e</i>.</p>

<p><i>y</i>, Fig. 59, is a cock graduated into eight equal parts and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
placed on the steam pipe <i>p</i>, to conduct the steam from the
box <i>z</i>, into the stuffing box <i>a´</i>, and from there into the pipe
<i>s</i>, then under the false bottom <i>r</i>, into the drum <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>The lid of the cast-iron box <i>z</i>, is provided with a safety
valve loaded with a weight corresponding to the pressure of
one atmosphere.</p>

<p>The wooden vessel or box <i>d</i>, the ground-plan of which is
shown in Fig. 62, serves for boiling the comminuted bones
in order to extract the jelly. This box consists of the following
parts:—</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 62.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p175.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p><i>n</i>, are cast-iron steam pipes occupying the entire surface
of the box, being placed at equal distances from each other,
and connected on their ends by semicircular pieces. The
steam, which is allowed to circulate in the pipes in order to
boil the liquid, enters through one of the ends which rises
up vertically and is connected with the cock <i>h´</i>, Fig. 59.
The other end is secured to the inner side of the box, which
is perforated for the admittance of the cock <i>o´</i>. Upon the
steam pipes lies a wooden framework with linen nailed
upon it, the object of which is to prevent the comminuted
bone substance from falling under the pipes. The frame
must, of course, fit closely into the box.</p>

<p>The cock <i>h´</i> graduated in eight equal parts serves to
admit steam into the pipes <i>n´</i>, and is opened either entirely
or half, or one-quarter, or one-eighth, according to the
stronger or gentler ebullition to be produced.</p>

<p>To prevent the steam from becoming stagnant in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
steam pipes <i>n´</i>, a small jet is allowed constantly to escape
through the cock <i>o´</i>. The latter serves also to run off the
condensed steam when it no longer possesses the heat required
to keep up ebullition.</p>

<p><i>p´</i>, Fig. 62, is a cock in the bottom of the box <i>d´</i> for
drawing off the gelatinous solution from the residue. The
box <i>e´</i>, Fig. 62, a ground-plan of which is shown in Fig. 63,
serves for evaporating the gelatinous solution, which is
effected by circulating steam through several tubular pieces
of cast-iron which form the bottom of the box and are connected
in a similar manner as the pipes in the box <i>d´</i>.</p>

<p>The cock <i>i</i> is graduated and similar to <i>h´</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p176.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The cock <i>r´</i>, Fig. 63, is similar to <i>o´</i>, Figs. 59 and 62.</p>

<p><i>s´</i>, Fig. 63, is a cock for drawing off the evaporated
gelatinous solution.</p>

<p>The wooden box <i>f´</i>, Fig. 59, a ground-plan of which is
shown in Fig. 64, serves for the reception and settling of
the evaporated gelatinous solution. Its bottom is constructed
in a manner similar to that of the box <i>e´</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 64.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p176-1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The cock <i>n´</i>, which is placed 14 millimeters (0.55 inch)
above the bottom of the box, serves for running the gelatinous
solution into the wooden cooling-boxes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<p>The bones as received in the factory are sorted by throwing
out the spongy material, etc. They are then steeped in
lime-water for a few days to free them from adhering particles
of flesh, after which they are dried and stored away
for future use.</p>

<p>The boiler <i>a</i>, is filled two-thirds with water, and heated
until the manometer indicates a pressure of 30°. In the
meanwhile the drum <i>e</i>, is filled seven-eighths with perfectly
dry bones, and steam is then admitted from the boiler <i>a</i>,
through the graduated cock <i>y</i>. The fact that the bones in
the drum are exposed to the proper temperature of 250° F.
is recognized by the thermometer <i>b´</i>, placed between the
cock and the drum.</p>

<p>To prevent the stagnation of the steam in the drum, <i>a</i>
small jet of it is allowed constantly during the operation to
escape through the cock <i>x</i>. The cock must not be opened
wider than is necessary to keep the temperature at 250° F.
By opening it wider, this degree would be exceeded, and
the gelatine-yielding substance would, in consequence,
undergo alteration. A quarter of an hour after admitting
the steam into the drum, the cock <i>t</i>, is opened, and again
closed after allowing a small portion of the condensed steam
to escape to the cock <i>u</i>, and, through this, into a box. This
operation is repeated every quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>To change the position of the bones, the drum is revolved
twice every half hour, by means of the gearing <i>q</i>, of course
closing the cock <i>x</i> during the operation.</p>

<p>By carefully following the above rules, the bones will be
thoroughly reduced in four hours. If, for instance, steam
has been introduced into the drum at 5 o’clock a. m. the
operation will be finished at 9 a. m. The cock <i>y</i>, is then
closed, and the steam allowed to escape through the cock <i>x</i>.
After the escape of the steam, the drum is emptied, by removing
the lid and turning it upside down. It is then refilled
with entirely dry bones, and the operation continued
in a like manner, day and night, if necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span></p>

<p>After the bones have been taken from the drum, they are
spread out under a shed, and, when dry, ground in a suitable
mill. The resulting flour, which contains the jelly-yielding
substance, is brought into the vessel <i>d´</i>, which, in
the meanwhile, has been furnished with sufficient water to
cover the flour 65 centimeters (25.59 inches) deep. The
mixture is boiled for three-quarters of an hour, being constantly
stirred to prevent the flour from forming a heavy
and dense mass which would hinder the quick extraction
of the jelly. Ebullition is then interrupted by closing the
cock <i>h</i>, and the fat floating on the surface skimmed off.
After allowing the gelatinous solution to settle, it is drawn
off by means of a faucet placed above the level of the flour.
Thirty bucketfuls of the gelatinous solution are then at once
poured into a vat and mixed with the condensed steam
drawn off by means of the cocks <i>t u</i>, during the reduction
of the bones in the drum. After allowing the mixture to
cool to 160° to 155° F., 20 kilogr. (44 lbs.) of pulverized
alum are added at once and as quickly as possible. When
the gelatinous solution has become transparent, it is drawn
off into the box <i>e´</i>, and a few bucketfuls of hot water are
poured upon the sediment in the vat in order to extract the
remaining jelly, which is effected by thorough stirring and
allowing to settle until the water is entirely clear.</p>

<p>After disposing of the 30 bucketfuls in the manner mentioned,
the remainder of the gelatinous solution is evaporated.
This is accomplished in the box <i>e´</i>, which is filled 8
centimeters (3.15 inches) deep with gelatinous solution, and
steam is then admitted into the tubular bottom pieces. To
promote evaporation and keep the fluid constantly in motion,
the cock <i>i´</i> is only opened far enough to keep up
gentle ebullition. During evaporation the solution should
be frequently stirred with an implement resembling a rake.
The nearer the required degree of concentration is approached,
the greater care must be exercised to prevent the
solution from boiling too strongly. The proper degree of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
consistency is obtained when half a saucer full of the solution
placed in a shady place in the air acquires in a short
time such a consistency that when touched with the finger
no impression remains. The cock <i>i´</i> is then closed, and the
jelly is drawn off into the box <i>d´</i>, which contains the 30
bucketfuls of clarified jelly, care being had to mix the two
solutions as quickly as possible. After evaporating all the
gelatinous solution and mixing it in the box <i>d´</i>, the whole
is heated to 158° F., by admitting steam through the cock
<i>k´</i>, care being had not to forget closing it as soon as the
above temperature has been reached. The solution is then
thoroughly stirred and permitted to settle for three hours
to allow of the precipitation of the lime salts decomposed
by the alum. The fluid, which is now perfectly transparent
and of a beautiful dark-yellow color, is then drawn off
into wooden cooling boxes 2 to 2.5 meters (6.56 to 8.2 feet)
long, 20 centimeters (7.87 inches) wide, and 16 centimeters
(6.30 inches) deep. The following day the gelatine is cut
into leaves 25 centimeters (9.84 inches) long and 12 centimeters
(4.72 inches) wide, which are dried upon nets.
When quite dry, the drying process is finished by bringing
the leaves into the drying-room which is heated by the pipe
<i>g</i>. (Fig. 59.)</p>

<p>The bone flour remaining in the box <i>d´</i> still contains
much jelly, which is extracted by pressure. This is accomplished
immediately after running off the gelatinous solution
into the evaporating vessel. The liquid which has
drained through the cloth frame previously mentioned, is
drawn off by opening the cock <i>p´</i>, Fig. 62, while the residue
in the box <i>d´</i> is placed in coarse bags and the jelly extracted
by subjecting the bags to strong pressure under an iron
screw-press. Before mixing the extracted fluid with the
solution in the evaporating vessel, it is recommended to
allow it to settle, as it is always more or less turbid. The
residue remaining in the bags is an excellent manure.</p>

<p>The modern process of preparing bone gelatine, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
now almost in general use is as follows: Clean bones are
selected for the purpose, and the operation commences with
the extraction of the fat by means of benzine, though some
manufacturers prefer carbon disulphide as a solvent, because
it is claimed that by reason of its low boiling-point it
does not injure the gelatine in the same manner as benzine,
and besides it leaves no smell in the degreased bones. It
is advisable to bleach the degreased bones, spread out in
thin layers and kept constantly moist, by exposure to the
action of air and light. The bleached bones are conveyed
to large vats for the purpose of extracting their mineral
constituents by digestion with hydrochloric acid. If the
gelatine is to be used as an article of food, or for medicinal
purposes, only the purest hydrochloric acid obtainable
should be used, while the ordinary article suffices for that
for technical purposes.</p>

<p>The vats are filled three parts full with bones and the
latter covered with a solution of hydrochloric acid of 10 per
cent. strength. Digestion is carried on until the bones
become soft, flexible and semi-transparent. The acid water
is now drained off, and a supply of fresh water added, and
then discharged. This is repeated until the last water is
entirely free of acid, which is known by adding a few drops
of silver nitrate, the absence of any white precipitate indicating
that the water is entirely free of acid.</p>

<p>The bones are now bleached in the manner as described
under skin-gelatine, preferably with solution of sulphurous
acid, the process with gaseous sulphurous acid being difficult
to carry out and considerable time is required for the
gas to completely permeate the cartilaginous mass. The
bleached bones are then conveyed to the boiling vats and
the resulting liquors treated in the same manner as described
under skin-gelatine.</p>

<p>As bone-gelatine solidifies with a larger content of water
than the product from skins, evaporation of the liquors may
be early interrupted and the resulting jelly cut into thin
leaves which are finally dried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>


<h4>COLORED GELATINE.</h4>

<p>Cakes or leaves not entirely colorless may be utilized for
colored gelatine which is employed for various purposes.
Coloring is effected by simply dissolving and distributing
uniformly a suitable quantity of coloring matter in the
clarified gelatine liquor previous to solidifying; of course
only water-soluble coloring matter should be used.</p>

<p>Colored gelatines are frequently used by confectioners and
in the household in the preparation of jellies, and the use of
poisonous colors should under all conditions be avoided.
Sufficient attention is not paid to this, because many of the
aniline colors which are now so much used for the purpose
are at least open to suspicion, while others, especially picric
acid, which yields a beautiful yellow color, are decidedly
poisonous.</p>

<p>The following coloring matters are perfectly harmless and
yield good results in coloring gelatine:</p>

<p><i>Yellow</i>: Caramel or sugar color. A still more beautiful
yellow is obtained by the use of an aqueous extract of
saffron.</p>

<p><i>Red</i>: Extract of cochineal.</p>

<p><i>Blue</i>: Indigo-carmine solution.</p>

<p><i>Green</i>: Mixture of indigo-carmine and caramel.</p>

<p><i>Violet</i>: Mixture of extract of cochineal and indigo-carmine.</p>

<p>While gelatine colored with the above-mentioned coloring
matter does not present such a beautiful appearance as
the product colored with aniline colors, it is entirely harmless
and suitable for culinary purposes.</p>

<p>Leaves of gelatine colored with aniline colors exhibit
beautiful colors and are used for many technical purposes.
The following colors may be employed:</p>

<p><i>Yellow</i>: Picric acid soluble in hot water.</p>

<p><i>Red</i>: Fuchsine or eosine.</p>

<p><i>Blue</i>: Water-soluble blue.</p>

<p><i>Green</i>: Iodine green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

<p><i>Violet</i>: Methyl violet.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Gelatine for Fining Purposes.</i></p>

<p>For fining beer, wine, etc., gelatine in leaves or in powder
is brought into commerce. For the preparation of leaves,
gelatine particularly well dried is carefully melted over a
water-bath and then ladled into sheet-metal moulds, and
allowed slowly to solidify.</p>

<p>The product brought into commerce under the name of
<i>Gelatine Lainée</i> which commands a high price is in many
cases nothing but thoroughly purified bone-glue of a dark
honey-yellow to brown color.</p>

<p>Fining powder for wine and beer is made by grinding
off-color gelatine cakes and freeing the resulting powder
from coarser pieces by sifting. The powder is white.</p>

<p><i>Liquid fining gelatine.</i> This preparation consists of gelatine-solution
suitably prepared, and represents a colorless,
or at the utmost slightly opalescent, product just sufficiently
concentrated to remain liquid.</p>

<p>Skin-liquors can only be used for the preparation of
liquid gelatine, as bone-liquors already gelatinize when they
contain scarcely more than 1 per cent. of glue. The skin
liquors are concentrated so far as to remain liquid at a
temperature of from 60° to 68° F.</p>

<p>A product answering all demands is obtained as follows:
A good quality of gelatine of a pale color is dissolved in a
sufficient quantity of water, the solution, in case it shows a
slight odor, filtered through animal charcoal, and then
brought into bottles. To prevent putrefaction the liquid
gelatine is sterilized as follows:</p>

<p>The filled bottles being placed in a boiler filled to a
proper depth with water, the latter is slowly brought to
boiling which is kept up for 15 to 20 minutes. The bottles
are then closed with corks previously boiled in the water.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Preparation of Gelatine from Ordinary Glue.</i></p>

<p>For this purpose ordinary pale-colored glue is allowed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
swell up for two days in cold strong vinegar. The vinegar
is then drained off and the glue which is now almost colorless,
is placed upon a sieve and allowed to float in a vessel
filled with water for 10 to 12 hours. It is then placed
upon a linen cloth, stretched in a room heated to at the utmost
68° F., allowed to drain and dry to such an extent
that on heating it to between 158° and 167° F., a thick
clear liquid is obtained. This liquid is carefully poured
upon plates of glass or marble, so as to avoid the formation
of air bubbles and when solidified the leaves are removed
and completely dried in the air. The product thus obtained
being entirely tasteless and almost colorless may be
used in the preparation of jellies, as well as for foils for
pictures, etc.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Preparation of Gelatine for Photographic Printing and for
Photographic Purposes in General.</i></p>

<p>Gelatine suitable for this purpose should be colorless and
free from all salts, since the latter would exert a disturbing
effect upon the chemical processes which take place during
the photographic operation. For the removal of the salts
the gelatine is treated as follows: Colorless gelatine of the
best quality is broken into small pieces and covered with
10 to 12 times the quantity of water, the latter being
changed every 15 to 20 minutes until the last water shows
no trace of lime, which is known by adding to the water
solution of oxalate; the absence of turbidity indicates that
the water is free from lime. The white of an egg is now
mixed with five drops of ammonia and twice the volume of
distilled water and shaken to froth in a bottle. This quantity
suffices for 6 to 8 ozs. of gelatine. The washed gelatine
is next melted in a dish and mixed with the white of egg.
One part of glacial acetic acid mixed with 250 parts of
water is then added drop by drop, stirring constantly until
sensitive litmus paper shows an acid reaction. The liquid
is now rapidly brought to the boiling-point, whilst stirring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
constantly, and then filtered in a warm place to avoid gelatinization.
The gelatine now contains only the salts of the
white of egg, some ammonium acetate and free acetic acid.
For their removal the solidified gelatine is cut into pieces,
which are placed in water.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Gelatine Capsules for Medicinal Purposes.</i></p>

<p>Considerable use is made of gelatine in medicine. To
disguise the disagreeable taste of some medicines they are
either mixed with gelatine solution or inclosed in gelatine
capsules. To prepare the latter, dissolve 8 parts of gelatine,
2 of sugar, and 1 of gum-arabic in 8 of water in a water-bath,
and dip the pear-shaped ends of iron rods into the
lukewarm solution. To facilitate the detaching of the gelatine
film from the rods, grease the pear-shaped ends with
oil. The capsules are dried by placing them in holes of a
corresponding size in boards. When dry they are filled
with the respective medicine, and closed with a drop of the
same solution.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Court Plaster.</i></p>

<p>Gelatine or isinglass 155 grains, alcohol 13½ fluid
drachms, glycerine 15½ grains. Water, tincture of benzoin,
each a sufficient quantity. Dissolve the gelatine in a sufficient
quantity of hot water to make the solution weigh 4½
ozs. Spread one-half of this in successive layers by means
of a brush upon taffeta stretched upon a frame so as to present
a level surface, waiting after each application until the
layer is dry. For the first two applications the gelatine
solution should be warmed merely to above its congealing
point, so that when spread out it may rapidly solidify
and at the same time adhere to, but not pass through the
fabric. Mix the second half of the gelatine solution with
the alcohol and glycerine, and apply it in the same manner.
Then reverse the taffeta, coat it on the back with the tincture
of benzoin and allow it to become perfectly dry. The
tincture of benzoin applied to the reverse side leaves a thin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
layer of resin which in a measure renders the plaster water-proof;
it is, however, advisable to repeat this application
once or twice. The addition of glycerine to the last portion
of the gelatine solution prevents the plaster from breaking,
and preserves its flexibility for a long time. When the
plaster is dry it is cut in pieces of suitable length and preserved
in well-closed vessels.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Gelatine Foils.</i></p>

<p>Large quantities of gelatine foils, which are leaves of gelatine
about as thick as a sheet of paper, are produced in
England and France where their manufacture forms a special
branch of industry. They are either simply colored or
printed with neat designs in gold or silver.</p>

<p>The fabrication is quite simple. Cover pure gelatine
with water, and after swelling up, pour off the water and
dissolve the jelly over a water-bath. After allowing the
solution to cool somewhat, add the coloring matter previously
dissolved in water.</p>

<p>In place of pure gelatine, a solution of ordinary bone-glue
may be used. In order to clarify it add O.14 oz. of oxalic
acid dissolved in water to every 5.5 lbs. of glue. To make
the foils more flexible add also one-half pint of spirit of
wine and O.28 oz. of rock candy or a small quantity of glycerine.</p>

<p>Aniline colors soluble in water are best adapted for coloring
the foils; for <em>red</em>, fuchsine, eosine or ponceau, for <em>blue</em>,
<em>blue de Parme</em>, for <em>green</em>, aldehyde green, for <em>yellow</em>, picric
acid, and for the various shades, mixtures of the above
colors.</p>

<p>A durable blue is also produced by indigo solution, yellow,
by decoction of saffron, green, by mixing blue and
yellow, red, by a solution of carmine in spirit of sal ammoniac,
and violet, by mixing blue and carmine.</p>

<p>The gelatine solutions are poured upon ground-glass
plates, previously polished with elutriated rouge, and rubbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
with Spanish chalk. The foils are so smooth upon the
glass side that when dry they can be detached without
much difficulty. If both sides are required to be smooth,
the foils are dried between two glass plates. In many respects
their manufacture resembles that of “Gelatine
Veneers.”</p>

<p>Gelatine foils are used for printing sacred images, visiting
cards, labels, in the manufacture of fancy articles, artificial
flowers, etc.</p>

<p>For the manufacture of artificial flowers very soft and
flexible sheets are made by adding ½ part of glycerine to
1 part of gelatine and mixing intimately in dissolving
the gelatine.</p>

<p>Such gelatine sheets brushed over in addition with Peruvian
balsam can also be advantageously used for tying up
wounds instead of gutta-percha cloth which tears easily and
rots soon. They form an air-tight bandage which clings
closely to the parts of the body, and beside the glycerine
contained in them exerts a beneficial cooling effect and acts
as an antiseptic.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Gelatine Veneers.</i></p>

<p>Franchi, as far back as 1814, prepared artificial ivory by
mixing gelatine solution with earthy substances. This
idea has been again taken up in modern times for the
manufacture of veneers imitating not only ivory, but also
avanturin, lapis lazuli, malachite, mother-of-pearl, and
tortoise shell. These imitations are much liked by manufacturers
of fancy articles, workers in leather, cabinet-makers,
etc. They are prepared as follows:—</p>

<p>The process may be divided into five principal operations:
1. Preparation of the glass and marble plates; 2.
Preparation of the glue solutions; 3. Pouring the colored
solutions upon the plates; 4. Transferring the layer of glue
to the layer of gelatine; and 5. Drying the veneers and detaching
them from the plates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Preparation of the plates.</i> Both marble and glass plates
are used for imitations of marble, but glass plates only for
imitations of mother-of-pearl. The glass plates must be
ground, but need not exceed O.11 to O.15 in. in thickness,
and only require careful washing and drying for imitations
of mother-of-pearl. For imitations of marble they should
be rubbed with an oiled linen rag. Other glass plates,
after being washed and polished with elutriated rouge
and water, are wiped with a soft rag to remove any particle
of the polishing powder. The polished surface is then
gently rubbed with a rag dipped in pure Spanish chalk,
and the excess of chalk carefully dusted off.</p>

<p>2. <i>Preparation of the glue solutions.</i> For one dozen plates,
each 10¾ square feet, soak 2 lbs. of good, colorless glue in
water for 24 hours, pour off the water and melt the glue in
a water-bath and stir in 3½ ozs. of glycerine. For imitating
marbles of two colors, compound 20 to 24 fluidounces of
this glue solution with the quantities of thoroughly ground
mineral colors given below; the rest of the glue solution is
mixed with 6.34 ozs. of zinc white ground very fine. For
imitating marble of three colors mix 14 fluidounces of the
glue solution with one of the coloring matters and 14
fluidounces with the other coloring matter, and the remainder
with zinc white. For imitating marble with four
colors, take 10 fluidounces of the glue solution to each of
the three coloring matters, and mix the rest with 4½ ozs. of
zinc white.</p>

<p>The proportions by weight of the mixtures for 10 different
varieties of imitations of marble and enamel are as follows:—</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Mix 20 fluidounces of the glue solution with 1¾ ozs. of
rouge and 2½ ozs. of zinc white, and the rest of the glue
solution with 6⅓ ozs. of zinc white.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Mix 20 fluidounces of the glue solution with 1¾ ozs.
of rouge, and the rest of the glue solution with 5¼ ozs. of
zinc white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

<p><i>c.</i> Mix 14 fluidounces of the glue solution with 1¼ ozs.
of zinc white and 1 oz. of rouge, 14 fluidounces of the
glue solution with 1 oz. of yellow ochre, and the rest with
5¼ ozs. of zinc white.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Mix 14 fluidounces of the glue solution with 1 oz. of
rouge, 14 fluidounces of the glue solution with ¾ oz. of
sepia, and the rest with 5¼ ozs. of zinc white.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Compound 20⅓ fluidounces of the glue solution with
1 oz. of quite concentrated and filtered solution of aniline
black, and the rest with 6⅓ ozs. of zinc white.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> Mix 10 ozs. of the glue solution with 0.8 oz. of rouge,
10 fluidounces of the glue solution with 0.8 oz. of yellow
ochre, 10 fluidounces of the glue solution with 0.8 oz. of
sepia, and the rest with 4¼ ozs. of zinc white.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> Mix 20.3 fluidounces of the glue solution with 1.41
ozs. of lampblack. For gray add sufficient zinc white to
produce the desired shade. The rest of the glue solution is
mixed with 6⅓ ozs. of zinc white.</p>

<p><i>h.</i> Mix 10 fluidounces of the glue solution with 0.8 oz. of
umber, 10 fluidounces of the glue solution with 0.8 oz. of
bole, 10 fluidounces of the glue solution with 0.8 oz. of
ochre, and the rest with 4½ ozs. of zinc white.</p>

<p><i>i.</i> <i>For enamels</i> mix 20.3 fluidounces of the glue solution
with 1 oz. of ultramarine, and the rest with 6⅓ ozs. of zinc
white.</p>

<p><i>k.</i> Mix 20.3 fluidounces of the glue solution with 1.41 ozs.
of chrome green, and the rest with 6⅓ ozs. of zinc white.</p>

<p>For imitating mother-of-pearl veneers, 0.42 oz. of silver
bronze, which need not be genuine, is ground with a little
glue solution or water and intimately mixed with the above
solution of glue. The bronze powder must not be in a dry
state when stirred into the glue, as lumps would be formed
and the veneers become spotted. In place of bronze, essence
of fish scales, which is of course far more costly, can be
used.<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> The glue solution thus prepared is then
compounded with different aniline colors according to the tint
desired.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2_2" href="#FNanchor_2_2" class="label">2</a>
This preparation is also known by the name <i lang="fr">Essence d’Orient</i>. The material
for its production is furnished by a small white fish very common in the
rivers of continental Europe. It accompanies the scales of this fish, and is
detached when the scales are triturated for a considerable time and thrown into
a vessel of water. To collect the essence the water is poured off upon a fine
hair sieve, which retains the scales and allows the water and the product
sought to pass through. The latter sinks to the bottom, and is obtained pure
by decanting the water. A little ammonia is added to prevent decomposition.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

<p><i>a.</i> For yellowish veneers no coloring matter is required,
or the desired shade is obtained by an addition of some
solution of picric acid.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> For colorless veneers or those of slightly reddish tints
a smaller or greater number of drops of a concentrated solution
of fuchsine are added in order to counteract the yellowish
color of the glue solution. For these imitations of
mother-of-pearl veneers, concentrated solution of gelatine
compound with 15 per cent. of glycerine can be employed,
especially when essence of fish scales is used.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> For <i>blue</i>, the glue solution is compounded with <i>bleu de
Lyons</i>, care being had not to use too much, as otherwise the
imitation becomes indistinct. The proper degree of coloring
is tested by allowing a few drops of the colored glue
solution to fall upon a glass plate.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> For <i>red</i>, solution of fuchsine or carmine is used, the
latter being obtained by dissolving commercial carmine
powder in alcohol.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> <i>Orange colors</i> are produced by an addition of solution
of <i>chrysaniline</i> generally sold under the name of Victoria
orange, and <i>violet</i> by adding aniline violet. For these, as
well as for the solution colored with fuchsine, the plates
must <i>not</i> be rubbed with oil, as even the smallest trace of
the latter discolors these colors in drying, or at least the
veneers will show spots without color.</p>

<p>3. <i>Pouring the colored solutions of glue upon the plates.</i>
For imitations of marble and enamel, the glass plates, after
rubbing with oil, are placed, rubbed surface up, in a per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>fectly
level position. The proper portion of the white
ground-mass, after becoming somewhat thickish, is then
poured upon the plates, and the gaps left free in pouring
filled in and smoothed with a knife-shaped tool of horn or
bone. Upon this white ground the respective colored glue
solutions are then poured in a zigzag form, and in conformity
with the desired design, drawn through the ground-mass
with a glass rod. If several differently colored glue
solutions are to be applied, as given, for instance, under 2<i>f</i>,
they should be poured in quick succession, so that the succeeding
color runs into the preceding, and a white strip
or spot remains between each color. The whole is then intermingled
by the glass rod, according to the design. If
the latter is to have sharply defined lines and spots, the respective
colored solution of glue is used somewhat thicker,
but if, on the other hand, the design is to be somewhat
blended, the glue solutions are used somewhat warmer, and
consequently more thinly fluid. After solidification of the
glue solutions the plates are placed in a cool room for two
or three hours.</p>

<p>Imitations of malachite are prepared in a similar manner.
Four glue solutions of different shades of green from the
darkest to the lightest tint are prepared and poured upon a
slightly greenish ground, so as to imitate the characteristic
curves and veins of malachite, which are then further
traced with a comb with teeth standing at unequal distances
from each other.</p>

<p>The glass plates set aside to be used for imitation of
mother-of-pearl are now taken in hand. The solutions of
glue are kept warm over a water bath and thoroughly
stirred every time before pouring them upon the plates.
The formation of a film on the surface of the glue solution
must be strictly avoided.</p>

<p>For pouring out the solutions it is best to use a porcelain
vessel provided with a spout and handle, and having a
capacity of about 6¾ fluidounces. The portion of glue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
solution required for each plate (1¾ flu. oz.) is then measured
into one of the porcelain vessels, and, after standing a
short time, poured upon the plate and uniformly distributed.
The production of a mother-of-pearl design requires some
skill and practice. A comb with teeth set ½ inch apart is
used. It is held in a somewhat oblique position, the teeth
are gently pressed upon the glass plate, and, with frequent
turnings of the comb at a right angle, cycloidal motions
executed. The operation is carried on from the front to the
back edge of the glass plate, and when the glue begins to
thicken on the edges, continued at the softer places until
the desired design is produced, care being had not to touch
places which have already acquired a certain degree of
solidity, as this would mar the pattern. After treating all
the plates in this manner, they are set aside in a cool room
for two or three hours.</p>

<p>4. <i>Transferring the layer of glue to a layer of gelatine.</i> For
each dozen of veneers soak 2½ ozs. of gelatine, and then
melt them in a water-bath, and after adding glycerine
equal to 10 per cent. of the dry gelatine, let the mixture
settle.</p>

<p>The glass plates treated with rouge and Spanish chalk are
now placed in a perfectly level position, and after pouring
5½ fl. ozs. of gelatine solution upon each of them, the gaps
left in pouring are filled in and smoothed with the glass
rod. The front edge of a plate covered with a colored layer
of glue is now, glue side down, placed upon the front edge
of a gelatine plate, while the back edge of the former is
gradually lowered until the glue plate lies firmly upon the
gelatine plate.</p>

<p>It may here be remarked that the gelatine solution must
only be allowed to cool off sufficiently to prevent the melting
of the glue plate on touching it. If it is cooler the
veneers will have blisters. It must further be looked to
that, before placing the first plate upon the gelatine plate,
no gelatine escapes, and that any excess only runs off after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
the back edge of the glue plate touches that of the gelatine
plate.</p>

<p>The plates are now allowed to rest quietly until the gelatine
is congealed, when they are removed to a cool place
where they remain five or six hours.</p>

<p>Imitations of mother-of-pearl are treated in the same
manner with the exception that the gelatine solution is
colored with the same coloring matter as the glue solution.
For colorless or yellowish veneers the gelatine solution is
not colored.</p>

<p>After six hours the first glass plate is detached from the
layer of glue by loosening the latter around the edges with
a knife blade, and the plate gradually lifted off commencing
at one corner. With some care and skill, this operation is
readily accomplished without detaching the gelatine mass.</p>

<p>5. <i>Drying and detaching the veneers.</i> The veneers with
the gelatine layer still adhering to the glass plate are now
dried. This is done in a heated room in which the veneers
are arranged upon frames so that they stand almost perpendicular.
The hot air for heating the room enters near
the ceiling while the moist air is drawn away near the
floor. The temperature of the lower zone where the fresh
plates are placed should not exceed 68° F. The plates are
moved up higher every day until, on the third or fourth
day, they have become entirely dry. Before removing the
veneers from the drying-room they should be tested in
regard to their dryness. They are sufficiently dry, when,
on pressing the finger nail upon the glue, no impression is
made.</p>

<p>After removal from the drying-room the plates are allowed
to cool off for at least two hours before detaching the
veneers. The operation begins by detaching the gelatine
layer on the edges with a very thin knife blade. The
operator then takes hold of one corner of the veneer and
draws it gradually and carefully from the glass plate.
After trimming the edges the veneers are ready for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<p>If the veneers are required to resist the action of water,
mix with the solution of gelatine compounded with glycerine
⅓ fl. oz. of a solution of 5 parts of chrome-alum in 100
of water to every plate, and immerse the veneers for a short
time after they have been detached from the first plate, in
a similar solution of chrome-alum.</p>

<p>Veneers prepared by these methods can be used for various
purposes in architecture and in the manufacture of
furniture. Tennessee and other marbles have been so
closely imitated, that when used for table plates, etc., the
fact of their being imitations could only be detected by the
closest scrutiny. The veneers are also much used for fancy
and inlaid work, for coating columns, etc. To prevent
their blistering and coming off, it is recommended to add
one-quarter of its weight of glycerine to the glue with which
they are to be attached to the articles.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Formo-Gelatine.</i></p>

<p>This product is used as a dressing in surgery, and, according
to Samuel Rideal, is obtained as follows: Gelatine
in aqueous solution is precipitated by formaldehyde H.COH,
or CH<sub>2</sub>O, as a substance which on drying is a white powder,
neutral, inodorous, and insoluble in water and dilute chemical
agents. In commerce formaldehyde is met with in
aqueous solution as “formalin” containing 40 per cent. of
formaldehyde. If 1 Cc. of formalin be added to 200 Cc. of
a 5 per cent. gelatine solution, the latter is changed into a
gelatinous mass, not melted by heat nor reduced by water.
If a smaller quantity of the formalin is added (1 in 1000;
the jelly is said to be meltable, but with a higher tenacity)
when dried it becomes insoluble in warm water. Formalin
in less proportion, though it does not prevent the dried
gelatine from dissolving in warm water, is said to improve
the “body” of the jelly and its keeping qualities, and also
the tenacity of the glue. The results of investigation show
that with up to 1 per cent. of formalin the solidity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
jelly increases; above that it declines. Up to 0.02 per cent.
(1 in 5,000) it redissolves in water after drying. Even with
this small proportion the firmness of the jelly is sensibly
increased. The English patent, 4,696, 1894, claims the addition
of formalin during the manufacture of size and glue
in such proportion that the product shall liquefy in warm
water.</p>

<p>In examining commercial sheet gelatines for printers’
and photographic use, they were often found to contain
small quantities of formalin. It seems to improve the quality,
a very small percentage increasing the tenacity, flexibility
and keeping qualities, while not affecting the transparency
or rendering the material acid. When applied to
articles that may be used as food, a strength of 1 in 50,000
in the final prepared product is not injurious to health, but
should not be exceeded. (Rideal and Foulerton, <cite>Public
Health</cite>, May, 1899, p. 568.)</p>

<p>Zimmermann applies dilute formaldehyde mixed with
glycerine, vaseline, oil or yolks of eggs, with or without
flour, to the surface of photographic films which are claimed
to be thereby rendered more pliable and not so hard as
when the formalin is applied by itself.</p>

<p>It will be seen that formaldehyde in more than traces
renders gelatine insoluble; the product, moreover, is almost
unaffected by water, is more or less hard and elastic and,
owing to the antiseptic properties of the formaldehyde is
nearly imperishable.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Use of Gelatine in Bacteriology.</i></p>

<p>Gelatine fit for this purpose must be clear and bright,
fairly neutral and of high gelatinizing power. For bacteriological
purposes a 10 to 20 per cent. solution of gelatine
in sheets or strips is made with meat broth, and this nutrient
jelly, which is obtained by clarification with albumen perfectly
clear and bright, forms a most useful medium for the
cultivation of micro-organisms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>


<p class="center"><i>Artificial Silk from Gelatine.</i></p>

<p>For the production of textile threads, Millar utilizes the
property of gelatine solution mixed with potassium dichromate,
becoming insoluble on exposure to light. For this
purpose a clear solution of gelatine is mixed with solution
of potassium dichromate in the proportion of 100 parts of
gelatine to 2 or 2½ parts of potassium dichromate. The
fluid should be of such a consistency as to allow of its being
drawn out into fine threads which on exposure to light
become insoluble. Silk woven from such threads is equal
in appearance to the genuine article but of course is not so
strong. It is affected by moisture, becoming limp, but regains
its normal strength when dry.<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<small>ISINGLASS AND ITS SUBSTITUTES.</small></h3>


<p>Isinglass is obtained from the air-bladder or sound, as it
is sometimes termed, of different kinds of fishes, especially
of the sturgeon, species <i>Acipenser</i>. It is used for culinary
purposes, fining beer and other liquids, for making court-plaster
and stiffening silk, though a good quality of gelatine
is practically equal to it for these purposes. A good quality
of isinglass should be pure white, semi-transparent, dry and
horny in texture, and free from odor. It should dissolve
in water of 95° to 122° F., without leaving any residue,
and, on cooling, should yield an almost colorless jelly.
From gelatine imitations it is distinguished by soaking it
in warm water and examining under the microscope, when
true isinglass will show a net-work of long, curling fibres,
while gelatine will be simply hyaline. Isinglass is often
imitated with the intestinal membranes of the calf and of
the sheep. This spurious article may be readily recognized
because it does not exhibit, like isinglass, a sort of shining
appearance when held before the eye and daylight, and
because, although inodorous, it has a saltish flavor. If it
be torn asunder it will be observed that it may be rent in
all directions, while true isinglass cannot be divided otherwise
than in the direction of its fibres. If a piece of artificial
isinglass be macerated in water it swells, but instead
of retaining its shape as is the case with the genuine
article, it becomes divided into several pieces, forming a
sort of curdy precipitate; and if treated with boiling water,
about one-third of its weight is left in an insoluble state,
and the liquor does not form a good jelly. Isinglass is
frequently adulterated with gelatine, which is inserted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
between the leaves and rolled up with it. The best indication
of this adulteration is the amount of ash; isinglass
yields only 0.9 per cent., while gelatine yields 4 per cent.,
and adulterated isinglass 1.5 per cent. or more.</p>

<p>1. <i>Russian isinglass.</i> Russia produces the best and most
isinglass. It is chiefly obtained from several varieties of
sturgeon, species <i>Acipenser</i>, which inhabit the Caspian and
Black Seas, and their tributary rivers. The <i>Acipenser
Gueldenstaedtii</i>, Br. yields the finest, best and whitest isinglass.
It is known by the name of <i>Patriarch</i>, and consists
of small horseshoe-shaped pieces rolled tightly together.
It is quite scarce and expensive. When the bladder is
merely dried in sheets, it constitutes <i>leaf isinglass</i>. When
several bladders are put together and folded before they are
completely dry, they form <i>book isinglass</i>. Each bladder
may also be rolled up and folded around a few pegs in the
form of a horseshoe, heart, or lyre, in which shape it is
dried. The latter is the <i>staple isinglass</i>, which, according
to its dimensions, is again divided into <i>long and short staple</i>.</p>

<p>Long staple isinglass of fine quality is produced in the
Oural. It is imported in loose leaves, and at times it is
twisted like ropes, this kind being preferred, as it is inferior
in quality only to Patriarch.</p>

<p><i>Siberian</i> purse isinglass is of moderately good quality and
is in general demand. A small kind of strings in a necklace
form is sometimes imported.</p>

<p>A very good sort of Russian isinglass comes into commerce
in leaves and books, and is known by the name of
<i>Samovey</i> leaf. It is obtained, according to the statements of
Russian merchants, from the common sheath-fish (<i>Siluris
Glanis</i>). The pieces are as large as a hand, of the thickness
of pasteboard, very solid, not very flexible and of a
white-yellowish color. It is inferior in quality to Astrakhan
isinglass, which is one of the best kinds.</p>

<p>In <i>Russia</i> the isinglass is generally prepared by boys
under the supervision of elder experts. The swimming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
bladder is first placed in water and left there for some days
with frequent changes of the water and removal of all fatty
and bloody particles. The warmer the water the more
rapidly the operation is completed. The bladders are
finally removed and cut longitudinally into sheets which
are exposed to the sun and air, being laid out to dry, with
the outer face turned down, upon boards of linden or bass
wood. The inner face is pure isinglass, which, when well
dried, can with care be removed from the external lamellæ.
The finer sheets thus obtained are placed between cloths
to protect them from the flies, and are then subjected to a
heavy pressure so as to flatten them out and render them
uniform. After this they are assorted and tied up in packages.
The packages composed of the isinglass of the large
sturgeon usually contain from ten to fifteen sheets and
weigh a pound and a quarter; those of the other contain
twenty-five sheets weighing a pound. Eighty of these
packages are usually sewed up in a cloth bag, or sometimes
inclosed in sheet lead.</p>

<p>The outer lamellæ of the air-bladder, after the isinglass
has been removed, also contain a considerable quantity of
glue which, when softened in water, is scraped off with a
knife and moulded into little tablets of about the size of a
silver dollar, and then dried.</p>

<p>2. <i>North American or New York Isinglass.</i> It is in thin
strips several feet long but ½ to 1½ inch wide. It is less
soluble than Russian isinglass, and yields frequently a dark-colored
solution. It is prepared, according to Dr. J. V. C.
Smith’s statements, from the air-bladder of the common
hake (<i>Gadus merluccius</i>), which is macerated in water for a
short time, cut open and subjected to pressure between iron
rollers, by which it is elongated to the extent of half a yard
or more. It is then carefully dried, packed and sent to
market. The air-bladder of the common cod (<i>Gadus
morrhua</i>) is prepared in a similar manner, but yields a
poorer kind of isinglass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>

<p>3. <i>East India Isinglass.</i> It would seem that for a long
time this has been exported from <i>Calcutta</i> to <i>China</i>, but has
only lately attracted the attention of European dealers. It
is prepared from the air-bladder of the <i>Polynemus plebejus</i>,
and comes into commerce either in the form of leaves or
purses which seem to consist of the unopened air-bladder.
East Indian isinglass has a disagreeable fish odor, due very
likely to careless preparation, which makes its use impossible
for many purposes, and, of course, depreciates its commercial
value. The oval-oblong purses are about nine
inches long, three and a half inches wide, weigh about 7
ozs. and have a dark-yellow color. East India leaf isinglass,
<i>i. e.</i>, the opened and dried air-bladder, consists of
yellowish-colored leaves eight to nine inches long, six to
seven inches wide, and about three-tenths of an inch thick.
The leaves are sometimes rolled out into long ribbons about
one-tenth of an inch thick, the surface of which is covered
in places with a thin film of lime.</p>

<p>What is known as picked East India isinglass is brought
into commerce in small shreds about two to three inches
long, and tapering at the extremities.</p>

<p>A variety of isinglass very white and pure and scarcely
inferior to Samovey leaf is brought from Manila. The
fish which yields it is caught on the coast of the Philippine
Islands, especially at Luzon.</p>

<p>4. <i>Hudson Bay Isinglass.</i> It is brought into commerce
in the purse form. Some specimens measure twelve inches
in length and three and a half inches in diameter, and
weigh one and a half ounces. It is of light-yellow color,
nearly transparent, without odor or taste. The inner lining
of the sac, which can be readily stripped off, is insoluble
in water, while the remaining portion dissolves to a slightly
colored jelly. We have been unable to ascertain from what
species of fish this isinglass is procured.</p>

<p>5. <i>Brazilian Isinglass.</i> This is imported from <i>Para</i> and
<i>Maranham</i>, and is also called <i>Cayenne</i> isinglass. For a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
time there existed a doubt from what species of fish this
isinglass was procured, but it is now settled that it is prepared
from the air-bladder of <i>Silurus Parkerii</i>, a fish which
is frequently found in the muddy waters of the rivers in
the province of Grao Para, where these waters mingle with
the sea.</p>

<p><i>Brazilian</i> isinglass comes in the form of pipe, lump and
honeycomb. On account of its dark color it is not in much
demand for ordinary use, but is frequently employed in
England for clarifying glue. When digested in water it
leaves much insoluble substance behind, being in this
respect also inferior to Russian isinglass.</p>

<p>6. <i>German Isinglass.</i> Under this name we may mention
the mucous membrane of the sturgeon (<i>Acipenser sturio</i>),
prepared in Hamburg. When boiled with water it leaves
16 per cent. of insoluble substance.</p>

<p>It is said that an excellent isinglass can be made from
the scales of shad and herring, which are first freed from
their silvery coating. This may furnish a useful hint to
persons who are near some of the great fishery establishments
of the country, at <i>Gloucester, N. J.</i>, and <i>Alexandria,
Va.</i>, for instance, where thousands of shad are scaled and
salted every year.</p>

<p>To give inferior qualities of isinglass a better appearance
and make them more salable, they are frequently bleached
with sulphurous acid.</p>

<p><i>Ichthyocolle Française.</i> Under this name, Rohan has
introduced a substitute for isinglass. The material used
for its manufacture is blood fibrin, which, after washing in
running water, is thoroughly kneaded and, after draining,
digested at 59° F. with dilute sulphuric acid of 8° to 10°
Bé. for eight days, after which the mass is freed from acid
by washing in running water.</p>

<p>The fibrin freed from acid becomes transparent and gelatinous
by treating with weak soda lye of 3° to 4° Bé. at
59° F., whereby it swells up and increases hourly in vol<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>ume.
After twenty-four hours it is taken from the soda
lye, and after removing the free soda by washing, heated to
212° F, in a water-bath. The fibrin dissolves and becomes
so thinly fluid that it can be filtered. 75 to 80 per cent. of
the water is then evaporated, and the fibrin thus prepared
can be used as a substitute for isinglass for fining purposes.
Ichthyocolla swells more quickly in cold water than isinglass;
15 to 20 per cent. divided in water forms a thickly
fluid substance, which on heating dissolves to a perfectly
clear fluid. For fining beer with ichthyocolla add 2 to 10
per cent. of pure tannin, which does not injure its power of
dissolving.</p>

<p><i>Isinglassine.</i> Under this name is known an isinglass
substitute prepared from the gelatinous material from
calves’ feet and other sources. The material is reduced by
machinery to a pliable homogeneous mass, rolled out into
sheets, dried, pressed and shredded.</p>

<p><i>Chinese isinglass</i> is identical with the <i>Japanese Agar-Agar</i>,
and is obtained by cleansing and boiling certain species of
algae found in Chinese and Japanese waters. This isinglass,
or gelatine, possesses the following properties:</p>

<p>Placed in cold water it softens without dissolving like
gelatine, and forms a structureless tubular mass which is
not sticky. By boiling, it dissolves more readily than isinglass,
but with greater difficulty than gelatine. A 1 to 2
per cent. solution is easily filtered through paper or linen,
and when cold forms a solid jelly clear as water and without
taste or odor. Jelly prepared with one-half per cent. of
Chinese gelatine is more solid than one prepared with 4 per
cent. of French white gelatine, retains its consistency longer,
and will stand a temperature of 86° to 122° F. before becoming
liquid. Used for jellies, or mixed with other foods,
it does not impart to them a glue taste never wanting in
bone gelatine. When decomposed by long standing, it does
not acquire a disagreeable odor, while decomposed isinglass
or gelatine exhales a putrid smell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

<p>Agar-Agar contains, according to analyses: Cellulose,
starch, gum, dextrine, vegetable mucus, vegetable wax,
resin, chlorophyll, albumen, a peculiar acid, and several
mineral substances.</p>

<p><i>Irish moss</i> (<i>Chondrus crispus</i>) which grows on rocks of the
American and European shores of the Atlantic Ocean,
yields a jelly which has been employed as a substitute for
isinglass, as a size, for thickening colors in calico printing,
and in stiffening silk. In a fresh or softened state the plant
is cartilaginous, of a brownish or purple, or frequently yellow
or green color. After washing in water and drying in
the sun it turns whitish or yellowish, and becomes somewhat
translucent and of a horny appearance. It has a
slight seaweed-like odor and a mucilaginous, somewhat
saline taste. One part of it boiled with 20 parts of water
gelatinizes on cooling.</p>


<p><i>Fish Glue.</i></p>

<p>This product, which is prepared in many localities from
fishes, must not be confounded with isinglass, though the
purer varieties may serve as substitutes for the latter or for
gelatine.</p>

<p>Jennings gives the following process for the preparation
of fish glue. The fishes are treated with dilute sulphuric
acid until the skin can be detached. The acid water is
then drained off and replaced by milk of lime to neutralize
adhering sulphuric acid as well as to saponify the fat. The
milk of lime is several times drained off and renewed, the
mass thoroughly washed, cut up in a hollander and treated
cold with solution of sodium hyposulphite, common salt
and alum. After a few days the liquor is drawn off and
replaced by a mixture of alum solution, dilute sulphuric
acid and nitric acid in which the mass is allowed to remain
for a few days. Fishes with dark skins are treated with a
mixture of hydrochloric and sulphuric acids. After washing,
the skin is removed and the fibres which have become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
detached from the bones are separated by digestion in
dilute solution of mercuric chloride and alum. Adhering
fatty parts are removed with warm milk of lime, the lime
is neutralized with hydrochloric acid, and the mass boiled
with water for the formation of glue. The resulting glue-liquor
is clarified with sulphurous acid and alum, and
when all the impurities have subsided, compounded with
acid sodium carbonate till all the acid is neutralized. The
finished solution is concentrated so that it gelatinizes on
cooling and can be cut in cakes which are dried in the
usual manner.</p>

<p>Fish scales, especially those of carps, are treated in a
similar manner. The bone-earth is extracted with hydrochloric
acid, the extracted material thoroughly washed, and
then boiled in soft water till it can be readily stirred. The
liquor is drawn off from the horny sediment, clarified with
alum, evaporated, and after all the impurities have subsided,
poured into moulds and treated like ordinary glue.</p>

<p>Considerable quantities of fish glue are produced on the
Norwegian coast from waste obtained in the preparation of
codfish. The fish when caught are cut open and the air-bladders
removed, which are dried and brought into commerce
as isinglass. The head is then cut off and the bones
detached in one piece. The flesh is dried in the air, and
forms the codfish of commerce. The heads and bones are
first treated with hydrochloric acid or directly boiled under
slight pressure in water, and the resulting liquor concentrated
so that it will gelatinize.</p>

<p>A substitute for isinglass, also for gelatine and glue, is
prepared by C. A. Sahlströhm, of Stockholm, according to
his patent, from fish and fish waste by treatment with
bleaching powder, potassium permanganate, and nitrous
and sulphurous gases.</p>

<p>For this purpose the fishes, or portions of fishes, are first
well washed in fresh water and then left for from three to
four hours in a solution of bleaching powder (in the pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>portion
of 2 lbs. of bleaching powder to 300 quarts of water).
After washing they are treated for about 30 minutes with a
solution of potassium permanganate (in the proportion of
1¾ ozs. of potassium permanganate to 250 or 300 quarts of
water), and then exposed to the action of the nitrous gas,
produced by heating 10 to 15 ozs. of nitric acid for every
88 lbs. of raw material. This gas may be first absorbed by
water, as in the manufacture of sugar, or sulphur dioxide
may be used instead of nitrous gas. The former would be
obtained by burning about 7 ozs. of sulphur for every 88
lbs. of raw material.</p>

<p>The material, after this treatment, is washed. Those portions
intended for the production of isinglass substitute are
freed from their outer skins and dried and pressed at a
gentle heat. The portions destined to produce gelatine or
glue are, on the contrary, exposed to a temperature of from
104° to 122° F. for from ten to twelve hours, by which the
material is mainly dissolved. The mass is then forced
through a strainer or sieve, and the liquor allowed to gelatinize
by standing for some hours. The jelly is finally
dried, as is usual in the manufacture of glue or gelatine.</p>

<p><i>Whale glue</i> is, according to Culmann, obtained in the
Russian island Jeretike from the liquor remaining in the
boilers after the extraction of the oil by means of superheated
steam. By reason of the raw and moist atmosphere
which prevails in that locality, even in summer, drying the
glue is not practicable, and for this reason it is brought
into commerce in the form of a compact jelly mixed with a
preservative and packed in tin boxes. The commercial
article contains 41.65 per cent. water. It is liquefied by
placing the can in boiling water, and melts at 176° F. As
shown by mechanical tests, it possesses great tenacity, and
two pieces of wood glued together lengthwise cannot be
separated at the joint but break alongside of it.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a><br />

<small>TESTING GLUE AND GELATINE.</small></h3>


<p>It is of importance that the manufacturer as well as the
dealer should know how to test the quality of a glue. This
may be done by chemical means and in a mechanical way.</p>

<p><i>Determination of moisture.</i> For this purpose a weighed
quantity of the sample, finely powdered, is for fourteen
hours exposed to a temperature of 217° to 230° F. It is
then cooled under the dessicator and reweighed. The content
of moisture is then calculated from the loss in weight.</p>

<p><i>Determination of ash.</i> The origin of a sample of glue
may be traced by examining the ash for phosphates of lime
and magnesia, bone-glue containing both, while skin-glue
is free from phosphates. Reduce a portion of the sample
to a fine powder, and weigh it in a tared constant crucible.
Heat slowly over a Bunsen flame until carbonized, then
remove the crucible to the muffle, and heat to bright redness
for 10 hours. Cool under the dessicator and weigh.
The increase in weight of the crucible is the ash of the
sample. This will vary from 1 to 2 per cent. in a gelatine,
2 to 3 per cent. in a good glue, 6 to 8 per cent. in a common
quality.</p>

<p><i>Determination of Acidity.</i> Kissling elsewhere determines the acidity
by suspending 30 grammes of the sample in 80 Cc. of cold
water for 10 to 12 hours in a flask connected with a condenser.
The volatile acids are then driven over by a current
of steam into a graduated cylinder. When the distillate
amounts to 200 Cc., distillation is interrupted, and the
distillate treated with standard decinormal alkali. When
the distillate contains sulphurous acid, a known quantity of
the standard alkali is previously added to the cylinder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

<p>An undue quantity of acid may be detected by the taste.
Glues may be alkaline from the addition of excess of lime
in the manufacture to correct the sourness of the jelly. For
uses where colors are concerned the glue must be neutral to
litmus; for adhesive uses this does not matter unless the
alkalinity or acidity is due to defective preparation (Samuel
Rideal).</p>

<p><i>Determination of Glutin.</i> The percentage of glutin in a
glue solution is determined by precipitating it with tannin.
The dense white precipitate formed is thrown on to a tared
filter, washed with hot water, dried and weighed. The
calculation is made on the basis that the tannate of glutin
has a percentage composition of 42.74 per cent. of glutin
and 57.26 per cent. of tannin.</p>

<p>Bisler-Beumat while employing the same principle prepares
two solutions: <i>a.</i> 10 grammes of pure tannin to the
liter. <i>b.</i> 10 grammes of pure isinglass and 20 grammes of
alum to the liter. The ratio in which the tannin is precipitated
by the isinglass solution, which Risler considers as
pure glutin, is then determined by titration. The tannin
solution is then diluted so that exactly an equal volume of
glue solution is precipitated by it.</p>

<p>In order to test a sample of glue, dissolve 10 grammes of
it together with 20 grammes of alum in a liter of water,
heat being applied if necessary. Next 10 cubic centimeters
of the tannin solution are taken to which an equal bulk
of glue solution is at once added, as one may be sure
that this quantity is not sufficient for the precipitation of
the measured quantity of tannin, because no glue found in
commerce is as pure as isinglass. The vessel containing
the mixed liquids being well shaken and the precipitate
having subsided, another cubic centimeter of glue solution
is added to the tannin solution which is next filtered
through a moist cotton filter. If <em>one</em> drop of the glue solution
still produces a precipitate in the clear filtrate, another
cubic centimeter is added to the tannin solution, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
again filtered, these operations being repeated until the filtrate
is no longer rendered turbid by the glue solution.</p>

<p>With the known relation of the tannin solution to pure
glue (isinglass), a conclusion may be formed from the number
of cubic centimeters of glue solution used as to the content
of glutin in the sample examined.</p>

<p>The percentage of glutin varies, of course, according to
the quality and origin of the glue. Bone glue of good
quality contains from 50 to 52 per cent. and skin glue from
65 to 75 per cent.</p>

<p>S. Dana Hayes analyzed two samples of American glue
of best quality and obtained the following results:</p>

<p>The chemical modes of testing glue give only the quantity
of glutin contained in it, but do not prove that the substance
combined with tannin corresponds to the actual
adhesive power of the glue, for it is possible that a glue
containing a large quantity of glutin may possess but little
adhesive power, and a jelly from which the glue is formed
may contain an equal amount of glutin with the latter, but
not possess an equal power of adhesion.</p>

<p>It is certain that the determination of the glutin alone is
not a criterion of the quality of glue. In the absence of a
reliable method of direct analysis, attempts have been made
to deduce the quality of glue from indirect properties.</p>

<p>One of these methods consists in immersing the sample
of glue in a large quantity of water at 59° F. for a considerable
time. The glue swells up, absorbing 5 to 16 times its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
own weight of water. The more consistent and elastic the
glue in this state is found to be, the greater its adhesive
power, and the larger the quantity of water absorbed the
more economical the glue will be in use. This method
does not give thoroughly reliable results, and should only
be employed with bone-glue, as skin-glue does not behave
in a similar manner.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 65.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p208.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A more reliable method is to test the strength of a glue
by the method first proposed by Lipowitz, which is based
on the weight-sustaining power of a jelly of known strength
and temperature. The test is executed as follows: Soak 5
parts of the sample in water, then dissolve it in sufficient
hot water to make the weight of the solution equal to 50
parts, and allow to stand for 12 hours at 64.4° F. in a glass
cylinder of uniform width to gelatinize. Cover the glass
cylinder with a tin cap perforated in the centre, Fig. 65.
Through the perforation is passed freely a stout iron wire,
at the lower end of which is soldered a piece of tin shaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
like a saucer, the convex side of it resting on the surface of
the jelly. To the upper end of the wire, which together
with the tin saucer should weigh 5 grammes, is soldered a
funnel weighing 5 grammes, and capable of holding up to
50 grammes of fine shot. The apparatus is gradually
loaded with shot until the saucer-shaped piece of tin is
forced into the jelly. The greater the strength of the jelly,
the heavier will be the weight required. From the determined
weight of the shot used, the relative value of the
glue as to its adhesive power is determined.</p>

<p>The following results have been obtained by comparative
experiments with this apparatus:</p>

<p>This table shows the following facts:</p>

<p>1. The percentage of water in the 14 dry varieties of glue
examined varies between 9.0 and 21. The loss of water
from isinglass is surprisingly large, especially as it cannot
be explained by an artificial admixture of water, since the
six varieties examined reabsorbed the same percentage of
water from the air. The percentage of water in the other
varieties of glue differs but little.</p>

<p>2. The various varieties of glue required different quantities
of tannic acid for their precipitation, the amount for
100 parts of glue varying between 66 parts and 76.2, or
calculated to per cent., between 49.4 and 56.8.</p>

<p>3. Placed in cold water, glue swells up and absorbs
from 12 to 40 parts of water. The behavior of the various
varieties differs very much in this respect, and in most of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
the experiments, with the exception of variety No. 4, the
percentage of glutin is in exact proportion to the quantity
of water absorbed.</p>

<p>4. The strength of the gelatinized glue varies between 12
grammes (185.18 grains) and 64 grammes (987.67 grains)
for a 10 per cent. solution. This property corresponds
neither with the absorption of water nor the percentage of
glutin.</p>

<p>Variety No. 4, in the table, contains 52 per cent. of
glutin, but does not gelatinize, its strength being therefore
equal to 0, while variety No. 14, with 49.4 per cent. of
glutin, therefore less than No. 4, shows a strength of 42.
As no close connection between the properties mentioned in
the table can be recognized, it is best not to be guided by
these properties alone, but to test also the behavior of the
glue in practical use. Such test consists in estimating the
adhesive power of the glue from the weight required to tear
asunder two pieces of wood glued together and dried. But
as the results obtained by this purely practical test must
necessarily vary on account of the impossibility of having
two surfaces of wood always exactly alike, and the uncertainty
of applying every time the same quantity of glue,
Weidenbusch’s method may here be given. It is based
upon the principle that sticks of plaster of Paris cast of
exactly the same material and of uniform size break under
the same weight when placed upon two supports and loaded
in the centre. If now such plaster sticks be saturated with
glue solutions prepared according to the same method, but
from different qualities of glue, a greater force will be
required for breaking them, and this force will be the
greater the better the quality of glue is.</p>

<p>The plaster sticks are prepared as follows: Reduce pure
crystallized gypsum to a fine powder, pass the latter through
a sieve having 324 meshes per square centimeter and heat
it to between 284° and 302° F. For casting the sticks
moulds of soap-stone are used. The moulds are made by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
boring in a piece of soap-stone, at a distance of about 1
centimeter from each other, holes with a diameter of 6
millimeters on top and 7½ millimeters on the bottom.</p>

<p>The gypsum is weighed off in portions of 1 gramme each,
mixed with 1 gramme water and cast in the moulds. The
solidified sticks are first dried at a moderate heat and then
over calcium chloride, and kept for use in an air-tight
vessel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 66.</span></div>
<img src="images/i_p212.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The glue solution is prepared as follows: The glue dried
at 212° F. is weighed, soaked over night in water, then
melted in a small glass in the water-bath, and finally
enough water is added so that the solution contains 10 per
cent. of dry glue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<p>The plaster sticks are for one or two minutes immersed
in the glue solution heated to 212° F., and then placed
vertically upon a glass plate until superficially dry, when
they are completely dried at 212° F. It is recommended
to color the glue solution with indigo, the uniform saturation
of the sticks being thereby more easily recognized.</p>

<p>The apparatus for testing the strength of the sticks consists
of a brass ring <i>a</i>, Fig. 66, having two notches to receive
the stick, and its diameter is divided into two equal
parts by an indicator. The ring is supported by a pin, by
means of which it is secured in a stand. The apparatus is
completed by an iron or glass cup which is suspended by
three cords, <i>i</i>, and the hook <i>f</i> to the plaster stick <i>b</i>. The
hook <i>f</i> is placed in the position indicated by the indicator.
Mercury is now poured into the cup until the plaster stick
commences to break. The weight required is recorded and
compared with a standard glue. During the experiment
the cup is suspended by the three cords <i>h</i> to the ring <i>a</i>, and
is thus caught when the plaster stick breaks. On the lower
end of the cup is a clip for emptying the mercury into a
vessel so that none of it is lost.</p>

<p>The “Artillery Werkstätte” at Spandau has adopted the
severing strain of two blocks of wood glued together. The
test is executed as follows: Three parts of glue (but not less
than 250 grammes) are mixed with 6 parts of water and
boiled in a steam bath until the weight of the boiled glue
amounts to only 5/9 of the original mixture. The reason for
this continued boiling is to ascertain whether the glue to be
tested retains the required adhesive power even after six
hours continued heating in a steam bath as frequently happens
in the workshop. With the glue thus prepared the
following breaking test is made:</p>

<p>Blocks of hard or soft wood 420 millimeters long and
40 × 40 millimeters cross section are cut in two, so that each
piece thus obtained is 210 millimeters in length. These
two pieces are then again glued together across the grain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
with the glue to be tested. The block is then placed in a
dry room at a temperature of 62° to 68° F. for 72 hours,
when the joint is tested as to its resisting power. At a distance
of 180 millimeters from the joint a hole is bored in
the block. Through this hole is pushed a bolt furnished
on the lower end with a hook to which a scale is suspended.
The block of wood is clamped to a table so that the joint
projects 1 centimeter beyond the edge. The scale is at the
start loaded with 25 kilograms, the load being every five
minutes increased 5 kilograms till fracture takes place.</p>

<p>Two such blocks, one of hard and one of soft wood, are
subjected to the test, and a serviceable glue must stand at
least an average load of 70 kilograms.</p>

<p><i>Determination of adulterations.</i> White lead, sulphate of
lead, zinc white, or chalk in quantities varying from 4 to
8 per cent. are frequently mixed with the melted glue to
improve the appearance of the finished product. Thus,
according to analyses by A. Faisst, Russian glues contained
in 100 parts foreign admixtures as follows:</p>

<p>The so-called patent glue which is opaque and of a white
color is produced by adding considerable quantities of white
lead to ordinary glue.</p>

<p>According to Barreswil, glue is frequently mixed with
lead acetate solution to protect it from putrefaction. Such
an addition, as well as the presence of white lead or sulphate
of lead, is detected by the introduction of sulphuretted
hydrogen into very dilute glue solution. In the presence
of lead acetate a black precipitate of lead sulphide appears
in the clear solution; if white lead or lead sulphate is present,
the white powder settling on the bottom is blackened
by the formation of lead sulphide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

<p>For the detection of other earthy additions, prepare a
very dilute solution of the glue in question and allow it to
stand quietly for a few hours. The heavy additions subside,
and after decanting the supernatant fluid is collected
upon a small filter and examined by the customary analytical
methods.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say what quantities of earthy constituents
actually constitute an adulteration, since it is claimed by
many practical men that a considerable content of earthy
parts is of advantage as regards the cementing power of
glue. Generally speaking it may, however, be said that
a glue containing more than 6 to 8 per cent. of earthy constituents
must be considered adulterated.</p>

<p>For many purposes, especially if the glue comes in contact
with colored materials as, for instance, in book-binding,
a content of free acid would exert an injurious effect upon
the colors, destroying or changing them. It is therefore
advisable to test the glue with blue litmus paper which, in
the presence of free acid, is reddened.</p>

<p>In testing a large number of samples of glue, Kissling
obtained the following results:</p>

<p>However, those who from their practical knowledge are
most competent to judge the commercial value of a glue,
scarcely require such complicated tests, as by taking the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
sample in their hand and looking at it, they can in most cases
tell its quality. Great hardness, a clear, rattling sound when
struck, and resistance to breaking are signs of good quality,
and if the cake is cut thick, it shows that the jelly possessed
great consistency. Many kinds of glues are intentionally
cut thin so that they will dry before spoiling. The derivation
of a glue from a sound jelly is recognized by the fine
cutting lines. When the jelly possesses but little gelatinizing
power and is in the first stages of decomposition or
putrefaction, or formation of sugar has already set in, it cannot
be poured into moulding boxes, as it would putrefy before
it has a chance to gelatinize. Such sick jelly is poured
in thin layers upon glass or metal plates so that it may
acquire sufficient solidity to allow of its being cut up into
leaves and dried upon nets. If the edges of the glue are
deeply indented and raised, the jelly, before drying, possessed
but little concentration (25 to 30 per cent.), and if
notwithstanding this, it acquired sufficient consistency to
allow of its being cut, it must have been very sound.
Glues cut thick and showing no indentations and raised
edges, are derived from excessively concentrated jellies
(30-35-40 per cent.). Such jellies lose in quality in
evaporating.</p>

<p>A high degree of transparency is a favorable sign as regards
the purity of a glue, substances inducing putrefaction
having been eliminated. Hence this property should be
worthy of recommendation, but the consumer having been
disappointed in the use of thin glass-clear glues, distrusts
also the thick-cut transparent product, preferring a turbid,
translucent or opaque article. For this reason the manufacturer
is forced to render glass-clear glue turbid with coloring
matter.</p>

<p>The color of the glue is also a means of judging it. To
be sure, chemically pure glutin is a colorless substance, but
glue is always colored more or less dark brown. Although
this coloration does not in the least impair the adhesive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
power, the manufacturer endeavors to produce a product of
as light a color as possible, and this is best effected by
bleaching with sulphurous acid. By this means the glue
not only acquires a lighter color, but also becomes more
stable, substances inducing putrefaction being destroyed by
the acid.</p>

<hr class="small" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a><br />

<small>CLASSIFICATION OF CEMENTS.</small></h3>


<p>The great variety of substances entering into the manufacture
of cements and pastes makes a division of them
extremely difficult. Stohmann divides them into the following
groups:</p>

<p>
1. <i>Oil cements.</i><br />
2. <i>Resinous cements.</i><br />
3. <i>Cements containing rubber or gutta percha.</i><br />
4. <i>Cements containing glue, or starch paste.</i><br />
5. <i>Lime cements.</i><br />
</p>

<p>Generally speaking, this division is correct; the only
change we would suggest is to apply the term <em>agglutinant</em>
or <em>paste</em> to bodies containing glue and starch paste.</p>

<p>When we attempt a division of the cements according to
the bodies to be cemented, we find that the result will be a
larger number of groups; as we must take into consideration
whether the articles to be cemented have to be heated
or not, whether they are to come in contact with water or
other liquids, and other circumstances which would necessitate
modifications in the composition of the cements
themselves.</p>

<p>According to this, we might group the cements as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>

<p class="hang">1. <i>Cements for glass and porcelain, for repairing broken
articles, for fastening glass letters upon show-windows,
etc.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>Cements for metals not exposed to an increase of temperature,
for instance, for tightening the joints of gas and
water pipes.</i></p>

<p class="hang">3. <i>Cements for stoves and other articles, which have to stand
an increased temperature.</i></p>

<p class="hang">4. <i>Cements for chemical apparatus, i. e., such as will have to
resist the action of chemical agents.</i></p>

<p class="hang">5. <i>Cements to protect vessels of glass, porcelain, or metal
against the action of fire.</i></p>

<p class="hang">6. <i>Cements for filling hollow teeth, for microscopical preparations,
and other delicate articles.</i></p>

<p class="hang">7. <i>Cements for special purposes, for instance, for cementing
meerschaum, tortoise shell, etc.</i></p>

<p><i>Chemical nature of cements.</i> The different varieties of
cement frequently contain substances which act chemically
upon each other, or upon the bodies to be united with them.
To determine the practical availability of a variety of
cement for a determined purpose, it is of importance to
know the reciprocal behavior of these substances towards
each other, as from this we are able to judge at once
whether a cement is suitable for a certain purpose or not.</p>

<p><i>Oil cements.</i> The fluid fats, commonly called oils—though
there are oils which remain solid at the ordinary
temperature, as, for instance, palm oil and cocoanut oil—may,
as regards their behavior on exposure to the air, be
divided into two large groups, namely, drying and nondrying
oils. As samples of these groups may be mentioned
olive oil and linseed oil.</p>

<p>If a thin layer of olive oil protected from dust is exposed
to the air, it will remain fluid for years and retain its characteristic
oily consistency. The only change it undergoes
is that it becomes somewhat more viscid and rancid, and
acquires a darker color, but it never dries up.</p>

<p>Linseed oil treated in the same manner solidifies in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
course of a few weeks to a hard, tough and elastic mass, resembling,
as regards its physical qualities, resin or rubber.</p>

<p>By compounding a drying oil with a small quantity of
litharge, pyrolusite, manganous borate, etc., and heating
the admixture to the boiling-point, it acquires the property
of drying in a few hours when exposed to the air in a thin
layer. Oil so treated has been changed to a varnish.</p>

<p>By bringing a drying oil in contact with a body possessing
strong basic properties a peculiar process takes place;
the sebacic acids contained in the oil combine with the
basic bodies to solid combinations which are insoluble in
water, and, on exposure to the air, change gradually into
masses as hard as stone. Such combinations, as regards
their chemical composition, resemble ordinary soap, and for
this reason are called insoluble soaps to distinguish them
from ordinary soap which is soluble in water.</p>

<p>Burned lime, calcined magnesia, whiting, ferric oxide,
litharge, and minium possess the capacity for forming insoluble
soaps on coming in contact with drying oils and,
still more quickly, with varnishes prepared from them.</p>

<p>The hardness of these soaps in time increases considerably
by the oil not saponified drying in. The oil cements are
principally used for tightening water and gas pipes, as they
resist the action of water, steam and gas.</p>

<p>The only drawback connected with these cements is that
they must reach a certain age before becoming entirely hard,
and that, on account of the high price of drying oil or
varnish which is absolutely required for their preparation,
they are rather expensive. The ordinary glazier’s putty and
the red lead and linseed-oil cement used in constructing
water and gas conduits belong to this group.</p>

<p><i>Resinous cements.</i> By resins are understood a number of
constituents of plants which exude in thick viscous masses
through incisions made in the trees, and on exposure to air
are gradually converted into less transparent, brittle masses.
When heated they melt more or less readily, forming a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
thick, ropy liquid, and brought in contact with an ignited
body they burn with a bright flame and much sooty smoke.</p>

<p>By making incisions in the bark of any of the whole
genus of <i>Pinus</i> belonging to the <i>Coniferæ</i> family, a viscous
mass of a strong odor, called turpentine, is obtained. It
consists of a solution of common rosin in the essential oil of
turpentine, and when distilled yields from 75 to 90 per
cent. of colophony or rosin, which remains in the retort,
and from 25 to 10 per cent. of the essential oil, commonly
called spirits of turpentine. Pure rosin is a brittle, tasteless,
and almost inodorous mass of a light yellow color and
a smooth, shining fracture.</p>

<p>The various resins found in commerce, such as shellac,
mastic, elemi, copal, etc., are formed in a similar manner.</p>

<p>The principal points of importance for our purpose are
the different degrees of hardness and brittleness and the
melting-points of the various resins. While some possess
but slight hardness, for instance elemi, others, such as copal
and amber, excel in this respect and their brittleness and
high melting-point.</p>

<p>To decrease the brittleness of resins, essential oils are
sometimes added, or resinous cements are mixed with oil
cements or a fat drying oil, or compounded with rubber
cement.</p>

<p>Resinous cements are either softened by heating or entirely
melted, or solutions of resins in volatile solvents are
used, which, in evaporating, leave the resin behind.</p>

<p>The resinous cements possess great power of resistance,
and are therefore well adapted for tightening water and gas
pipes, but they have the disadvantage of not standing a
high temperature and possessing a certain degree of brittleness
which renders them unfit for the cementing of articles
exposed to frequent shocks.</p>

<p>Many of these cements, especially those prepared with
pitch or asphaltum, can be produced at a very low cost,
and do excellent service for water-proofing vessels, water-reservoirs,
brickwork, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span></p>

<p><i>Rubber and gutta-percha cements.</i> Caoutchouc, commonly
called India rubber, or briefly rubber, is derived from the
milky juices of certain tropical plants. It is distinguished
by great elasticity and indifference to chemical agents.</p>

<p>Both these properties make it a valuable material for
cement, and it is much used for this purpose either in the
form of solution or as a constituent of other compositions.
For cements which are to have a certain degree of elasticity
combined with indifference toward chemical agents, it is
absolutely indispensable, as no other known body possesses
these properties in such a high degree.</p>

<p>The derivation of gutta percha is similar to that of
rubber. At an ordinary temperature it forms solid and
very tenacious masses, of a leather-like consistency, but at
a somewhat higher temperature (below the boiling-point of
water) it is converted into a very plastic, soft mass, which
can be drawn into very fine threads, and rolled to very
thin plates.</p>

<p>By itself or mixed with other substances it furnishes an
excellent cement, possessing the valuable properties of
tenacity and pliancy when exposed to shocks. As regards
resistance to the action of water and chemical agents it is
almost equal to rubber, and, for certain purposes, is frequently
preferred to the latter.</p>

<p><i>Glue and starch cements.</i> By itself, <i>i. e.</i>, converted by
boiling with water into a viscous mass which solidifies on
cooling, glue cannot be classed with the cements; the same
applies to paste, <i>i. e.</i>, starch or flour swelled and boiled in
water.</p>

<p>But compounded with other substances both yield excellent
cements, in which a part of the properties distinguishing
glue solution and paste is preserved. They both
possess the property of decreasing the brittleness of many
cements, but unfortunately the latter thereby lose their
power of resisting the action of water; for starch as well as
glue swells in water, and the latter, when moist, passes
quickly into putrefaction and destroys the cement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

<p>In a wider sense isinglass, compounds of glue and
vinegar, of lime and glue, etc., must be classed with the
glue cements, and ordinary flour and shoemakers’ paste
with starch cements.</p>

<p><i>Lime Cements.</i> Lime possesses the property of forming
insoluble combinations with egg albumen or caseine, this
being the reason why lime cements, of which there are a
great number, are generally composed of burned lime and
one or the other of the above substances. Lime compounded
with a solution of water-glass forms also very
solid and durable cements.</p>

<p>Although the cements and agglutinants mentioned in
the foregoing are most frequently used, a compound of
different cements is often employed, in consequence of
which the composition of many cements is very complicated.</p>

<p>In the following we give a description of the preparation
of the different kinds of cement, according to the manner
of their employment.</p>

<small>PREPARATION OF CEMENTS, PASTES, AND MUCILAGES.</small></h3>


<h4>OIL CEMENTS.</h4>

<p>Oil cements, as already explained, must be considered as
a variety of soaps insoluble in water, formed by the action
of drying oils or varnish upon various basic combinations.</p>

<p>The most important of this class is the cement used for
securing window-panes. Good glaziers’ putty is a product
of extraordinary durability, and, besides for puttying glass
and wood, can also be used for joining many other bodies.</p>

<p><i>Putty.</i> This is prepared by mixing fine whiting with
linseed oil or linseed-oil varnish. The whiting should be
passed through a sieve of 42 meshes to the inch. It should
be perfectly dry before sifting, and be thoroughly incorporated
with the oil.</p>

<p>As the work of kneading large masses with the hands or
feet must be continued for a long time in order to obtain an
entirely uniform product, and is consequently very laborious,
it is recommended to use the following contrivance:</p>

<p>Two wooden rollers rest in a suitable frame, and can be
brought together or removed from each other by means of
two screws. When the mixture of whiting and linseed oil
is of sufficient consistency to allow kneading, it is fashioned
into a cylinder and rolled out between the above rollers to
a long, thin band, which is caught in a vessel. The band
is balled together, the ball reformed into a cylinder, and
the latter again passed through the rollers, the operation of
balling and rolling being continued until a uniform mass
is obtained.</p>

<p>The finished product should be kept in oiled paper or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
under water. White lead is sometimes mixed with the
putty, and other pigments to give color as desired. Hard
putty may be softened by rolling between the hands.</p>

<p><i>French putty.</i> Boil 7 lbs. of linseed oil with 4 lbs. of
burnt umber for 2 hours. Then add 10 lbs. of white lead
and 5½ lbs. of chalk.</p>

<p><i>Soft putty.</i> Whiting 20 lbs., white lead 2 lbs., linseed
oil and olive oil 1 gill each.</p>

<p>Mix the whiting and the white lead with the necessary
quantity of linseed oil, to render the putty of the proper
consistence, the olive oil being added to the linseed oil before
kneading. The object of using olive oil is to prevent the
white lead from hardening, and it preserves the putty in a
state sufficiently soft to adhere at all times, and not, by getting
hard and cracking off, suffering the wet to enter, as is
often the case with ordinary hard putty.</p>

<p><i>Litharge cement.</i> By mixing litharge reduced to a fine
powder with linseed oil, a yellow cement is obtained which
gradually solidifies to a mass as hard as stone.</p>

<p><i>Red lead cement</i> is made by mixing red lead with linseed
oil to a paste. It is used for cementing the joints of metal
pipes.</p>

<p>Lead preparations furnish excellent cements, but have
the disadvantage of great weight and a high price. For
many purposes a part of the lead combination can be suitably
replaced by a substance of less weight, such as whiting,
or, still better, burned lime slacked with sufficient water to
convert it into a powder.</p>

<p>The quantity of the substitute added varies very much,
there being, for instance, many varieties of so-called red lead
oil cement, which contain only about 10 per cent. of red lead.</p>

<p><i>Cement for wash basins.</i> Finely powdered glass (sifted) 2
parts, litharge 2 parts, linseed-oil varnish 1 part.</p>

<p>Wet the powders slightly with the oil, heat and gradually
add the rest. Do not use the basin for several days. Finely
powdered glass or glass meal may be made by heating glass,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
throwing it in cold water, grinding the fractured pieces, and
washing by stirring up in water, and allowing the finer
particles to float off into a second vessel. Collect this fine
powder when sufficient has settled in the vessel and sift it
through a very fine sieve.</p>

<p><i>Zinc-white cement</i> is prepared similar to putty or red-lead
cement. It may, however, be made as follows: Mastic 2
parts, dammar 4 parts, sandarac 6 parts, Venetian turpentine
8 parts, turpentine 10 parts, benzole 12 parts, zinc
white 14 parts.</p>

<p>The resins are powdered, while the Venetian turpentine,
ordinary turpentine, and benzole, are put in a bottle, and
then the powdered resins put in. The whole is shaken and
allowed to stand for the resins to dissolve. The solution is
filtered through cotton-wool and rubbed up with sufficient
zinc-white to form a cement. Dilute with benzine if
necessary.</p>

<p><i>Mastic cement, mastic or pierres de mastic.</i> Under this
name masses are brought into commerce which are well
adapted for moulding ornaments, such as figures, columns,
etc., to be exposed to the weather. They are comparatively
cheap, and it is rather remarkable that they are not more
generally known and used for technical purposes.</p>

<p>To prepare large quantities of this cement suitable mills
and mixing vessels are required, as the conversion of the
materials into a dust-like flour is an indispensable condition
of the success of the work. The materials most generally
used are fine quartz sand, finely ground calcareous sand,
and varying quantities of litharge or zinc oxides, besides as
small a quantity of linseed oil as possible.</p>

<p>The linseed oil combines with the litharge or zinc oxide
to an insoluble soap, which incloses the other material and
forms a mass acquiring the hardness of sandstone in thirty
to fifty hours.</p>

<p>After converting the materials into a fine powder, the
mixing is accomplished in barrels filled about three-quarters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
full and revolved by water-power. When a thorough mixture
has been effected the pulverulent mass is placed in
sheet-iron vessels and saturated with linseed oil, and then
moulded at once, as it solidifies in one or two days.</p>

<p><i>French mastic.</i> Quartz sand 300 parts, pulverized limestone
100, litharge 50, linseed oil 35.</p>

<p><i>Paget’s mastic.</i> Sand 315 parts, whiting 105, white lead
25, calcined red lead 10, lead acetate solution 45, linseed
oil 35.</p>

<p>The mastic may be colored by adding pigments.</p>

<p><i>Water-proof cement.</i> <i>A.</i> Rubber 7 parts, oil of turpentine
140, linseed oil 40. <i>B.</i> Turpentine 100 parts, sulphuric
acid 3, zinc-white 10.</p>

<p>To prepare solution <i>A</i>, place the rubber in the oil of
turpentine in a bottle. It swells very much without
actually dissolving. After adding the linseed oil, reduce
the entire mass by boiling to one-half the volume originally
occupied by it.</p>

<p>Solution <i>B</i> is prepared by stirring the sulphuric acid into
the turpentine and allowing it to stand for twelve hours.
To remove the sulphuric acid, the thick mass which has
been formed is then kneaded in water in which the zinc
oxide has been distributed. After drying, the resulting
mass is dissolved in the warm fluid <i>A</i>.</p>

<p><i>Another formula</i> is as follows: Linseed oil 8 parts, litharge
12, burnt lime 88.</p>

<p>Boil the linseed oil and litharge half an hour, then stir
the lime into the hot mass, and use the mixture hot. This
cement is excellent for filling in joints between stones, for
flat roofs, water reservoirs, etc. For a better adhesion of
the cement, apply a coat of linseed oil varnish to the surfaces
to be cemented. Porous stones are made water-proof
by heating the cement in a boiler and adding sufficient
linseed oil to form a mass which can be readily worked
with a smoothing board. Apply as hot as possible.</p>

<p><i>Serbat’s mastic.</i> Pyrolusite 60 parts, sulphate of lead 60,
linseed oil 10.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>

<p>After thoroughly drying the materials, mix the sulphate
of lead with the linseed oil, then add 20 parts of the pyrolusite
and, after mixing and working it thoroughly, add
gradually the rest of the pyrolusite in small portions and
kneading constantly.</p>

<p><i>Stephenson’s oil cement.</i> Litharge 20 parts, unslaked lime
10 parts, sand 10 parts, hot linseed oil 3 parts.</p>

<p><i>Alum cement.</i> Dissolve good hard soap, by heating in
rain water, dilute the thickly fluid mass and add saturated
alum solution as long as a precipitate is formed. Collect
the gelatinous precipitate of alumina soap thus formed
upon a cloth, and, after draining, pour rain water over it
ten to twelve times to remove the salts as much as possible.
After washing, dry the alumina soap, and rub it to a fine
powder.</p>

<p>To prepare cement rub a portion of the powder with
sufficient linseed-oil varnish to form a plastic dough, which
is used for filling in the joints.</p>

<p>This cement is water-proof, resists high temperatures
without being absolutely fire-proof, and, on account of its
light color, is well adapted for joining marble plates, etc.</p>

<p><i>Oil cement for glass.</i> Litharge 30 parts, burnt lime 20,
pipe-clay 10, linseed-oil varnish 6.</p>

<p><i>Oil cement free from lead for steam pipes.</i> Graphite 12
parts, heavy spar 16, slaked lime 6, boiled linseed oil 6.</p>

<p><i>Oil cements for steam pipes.</i> I. Litharge 25 parts, air-slaked
lime 10, quartz sand 10.</p>

<p>Mix the ingredients quickly with the linseed oil and
work the mass thoroughly in a hot mortar. Coat the defective
places in the pipes with linseed-oil varnish, apply
the cement hot and when partially solid, make it still
tighter by heating.</p>

<p>II. Boil 60 parts of graphite, 50 of air-slaked lime, 60 of
elutriated heavy spar in 35 of linseed oil, stirring constantly.
Apply the mixture hot.</p>

<p><i>Oil cement for marble.</i> Elutriated litharge 10 parts,
brick dust 100, linseed oil 20.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<p>Prepare in the same manner as glaziers’ putty. For
various colors add zinc white for white, red lead for red,
pyrolusite for brown, etc. Previous to applying the cement
saturate the surfaces of the stones to be cemented with linseed-oil
varnish.</p>

<p><i>Oil cement for porcelain.</i> Stir 20 parts of white lead and
12 of white pipe-clay into 10 of boiling linseed oil previously
boiled and knead the mass thoroughly. After cementing
let the articles stand quietly for several weeks.</p>

<p><i>Diamond cement.</i> Litharge 30 parts, air-slaked lime 10,
whiting 20, graphite 100, linseed oil 40. Apply hot. This
is an excellent cement for metal.</p>

<p><i>Hager’s diamond cement.</i> Whiting 16 parts, elutriated
graphite 50, litharge 16.</p>

<p>Mix the pulverized ingredients with sufficient old, thick
linseed oil to form a plastic dough.</p>


<h4>RESINOUS CEMENTS.</h4>

<p><i>Resinous cement for amber</i> is obtained by melting mastic
in linseed oil. Volatile copal lacquer can also be advantageously
used for the purpose.</p>

<p><i>Cement for turners.</i> Melt 1 lb. of rosin in a tin can over
the fire, and when melted add 4 ozs. of pitch; while these
are boiling add brick dust until, by dropping a little on a
cold stone, you think it is hard enough. In winter it may
be found necessary to add a little tallow.</p>

<p>By means of this cement a piece of wood may be fastened
to the chuck, which will hold when cool, and when the
work is finished, it may be removed by a smart blow with
the tool. All traces of the cement may be removed from
the work by repeated applications of benzine. To use this
cement, chip off as much as will cover the chuck to the
1/16th of an inch, spread it over the surface in small pieces,
mixing it with ⅛ of its bulk of gutta-percha, then heat an
iron to a dull red heat, and hold it over the chuck till the
mixture and gutta-percha are melted and liquid. Stir the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
cement until it is homogeneous, chuck the work, lay on a
weight to enforce contact, leave it at rest 20 minutes.</p>

<p>The following cement is much employed and serviceable
for the use of turners and artisans in general.</p>

<p>Reduce 1 lb. of whiting to a fine powder, and heat to
redness so as to expel all the water. When cold this is
mixed with 1 lb. of black rosin and 1 oz. of beeswax previously
melted together, and the whole stirred till of uniform
consistence.</p>

<p><i>Cement for ivory and bone.</i> Melt at a moderate heat equal
parts of white wax, rosin, and oil of turpentine to form
a thickly-fluid mass. For coloring the cement add elutriated
red lead, ultramarine, etc.</p>

<p><i>Cement for white enameled clock-faces.</i> Dammar resin 100
parts, copal 100, Venice turpentine 110, zinc white 60,
ultramarine 3.</p>

<p>Apply hot and polish when cold and hard.</p>

<p><i>Cements for glass.</i> 1. Melt carefully 60 parts of bleached
shellac and 10 of turpentine. If too thick, dilute with
turpentine.</p>

<p>2. Shellac 20 parts, elemi 5, turpentine 10. Prepare as
above.</p>

<p><i>Cement for glass upon glass.</i> Shellac 10 parts, turpentine
2, pulverized pumice stone 10.</p>

<p><i>Cement for glass upon metal.</i> Melt together 40 parts of
rosin, 20 of rouge, 10 of wax, and 10 of turpentine. Apply
hot to the surfaces to be cemented.</p>

<p><i>Cement for metal letters upon glass.</i> Rosin 42 parts, turpentine
4, plaster of Paris 5.</p>

<p><i>Cement for wood.</i> 100 parts of shellac and 45 of strong
spirit of wine.</p>

<p>This cement serves for joining wood, which, on account
of exposure to water, cannot be glued. Apply the cement
to the surface of one of the pieces, and after placing upon
it a piece of tissue paper press upon it the other piece of
wood previously coated with the cement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p><i>Cement for knife handles.</i> Melt together 20 parts of rosin,
5 of sulphur, and 8 of iron filings.</p>

<p>Pour some of the hot mixture into the handle, and then
push in the knife previously heated.</p>

<p><i>Cement for petroleum lamps.</i> Boil 12 parts of rosin in 16
of strong lye until it is entirely dissolved and on cooling
forms a tenacious solid mass. Dilute this with 20 parts of
water, and carefully work into it 20 parts of plaster of
Paris. This cement is insoluble in petroleum, and is especially
adapted for cementing the glass parts of lamps to the
metal. It is also a good material for stoppers for petroleum
bottles.</p>

<p><i>Cement for porcelain.</i> Rosin, 14 parts; elemi, 7; shellac,
7; mastic, 7; sulphur, 42; brick dust, 20.</p>

<p><i>Cement for porcelain which is to be heated.</i> Heat carefully
10 parts of amber in a large spoon, stirring constantly, until
it evolves heavy vapors of a strong odor. Rub the melted
mass as finely as possible, and after placing the powder in a
bottle pour over it a mixture of bisulphide of carbon and
benzine. Close the bottle air-tight to prevent the evaporation
of the very volatile solvent. When the powder is dissolved
remove the cork and replace it by one provided with
a small brush. The application of the cement and pressing
together of the parts to be cemented must be effected as
quickly as possible. In articles properly cemented the
joint can only be detected by the closest examination.
This cement holds so well that cups and saucers, soup-tureens,
etc., mended with it can be used for years.</p>

<p><i>Cement to withstand the action of petroleum.</i> Dissolve 5
parts of shellac, 1 of turpentine in 15 of petroleum. This
cement is quite elastic.</p>

<p><i>Cement for mica.</i> A colored cement for joining sheets of
mica is prepared as follows: Soak clean gelatine in water,
and when swelled squeeze out the excess of water by pressure
between a cloth, then melt the gelatine by the heat of
a water-bath, and stir in just enough proof spirit to make it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
fluid. To each part of this solution add, while stirring, ¼
oz. of gum ammoniac and 1½ ozs. of gum mastic dissolved
in 4 ozs. of rectified alcohol. Put the mixture into bottles,
and when required for use stand the bottle in hot water.
This cement resists cold water.</p>

<p><i>Cement for horn, whalebone and tortoise shell.</i> Dissolve
gum mastic 10 parts and turpentine 4, in 12 of linseed oil.
Apply hot.</p>

<p><i>Cement for terra-cotta articles.</i> Melt together 70 parts of
rosin, 70 of wax and 16 of sulphur, and stir into the mass 8
parts of hammer slag and 8 of quartz sand. Coat the fractured
surfaces with oil of turpentine, apply the cement as
quickly as possible, and press the surfaces together. It is
advisable to heat the terra cotta previously to 158° or 176°
F. After cementing the article, smooth the joint with a
heated knife and dust very fine terra-cotta powder through
a linen bag upon the soft cement in order to give it exactly
the same color as the article itself.</p>

<p><i>Mastic cement for glass.</i> Gum mastic 15 parts, bleached
shellac 10, turpentine 5.</p>

<p>This mass sufficiently diluted with hot oil of turpentine
furnishes an excellent cement for fractured glass and gems.
Being colorless, the joint can scarcely be detected, provided
the cementing has been skilfully done.</p>

<p>To attach gems to glass of the same color, the cement is
colored with aniline colors dissolved in spirit of wine, care
being had to give it the same shade as the gem and the
glass.</p>

<p><i>Stick mastic cement.</i> Melt together, at as low a temperature
as possible, 10 parts of mastic and one of turpentine,
and pour the mass into suitable moulds.</p>

<p>For use, heat the fractured surfaces of the article strongly,
so that the cement on being rubbed over them melts, then
press the surfaces together and continue the pressure until
the cement solidifies.</p>

<p><i>Sulphur cement for porcelain.</i> White pitch 18 parts, sul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>phur
28, bleached shellac 4, gum mastic 8, elemi 8, glass
meal 28. Melt all together, except the glass meal and stir
the latter into the melted mass.</p>

<p><i>Insoluble cement for wooden vessels.</i> Melt together 60 parts
of rosin, 20 of asphalt, and 40 of brick dust. Pour the hot
mixture into the joints. This cement resists the action of
lye, quick lime, sulphuric and hydrochloric acids.</p>


<h4>RUBBER CEMENTS.</h4>

<p>These cements are very useful, but owing to the inflammable
nature of the components, great care should be taken
to guard against fire while preparing them. They should
never be made near a naked fire, as the benzine, carbon
disulphide or chloroform used to dissolve the rubber is very
volatile, and the vapor given off permeates the air until,
coming near a source of light, the whole air becomes one
vivid sheet of flame. Vessels which are used should be
closed, and if possible put out of doors. If heat is required
to assist the solvent action, use a sand or hot-water bath,
but on no account bring near a fire.</p>

<p><i>Cements for glass.</i> I. Rubber 1 part, gum mastic 12,
dammar 4, chloroform 50, benzine 10.</p>

<p>II. Rubber 12 parts, chloroform 500, gum mastic 120.</p>

<p>This cement adheres immediately, and possesses a high
degree of elasticity. It may be used to advantage for joining
together the glass panes of hot-houses.</p>

<p>III. Dissolve, without application of heat, rubber 2 parts
and gum mastic 6, in 100 of chloroform. This cement is
perfectly transparent. It should be applied as quickly as
possible, as it sets in a very short time.</p>

<p><i>Soft rubber cement.</i> Melt 10 parts of tallow in a brass pan
and gradually add 150 parts of rubber in small pieces, and
stir constantly until all the rubber is dissolved. Keep in
readiness a well-fitting lid to be able to extinguish the
flame immediately in case the rubber catches fire. When
all is melted stir in 10 parts of slaked lime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span></p>

<p>This cement is especially adapted for sealing bottles containing
caustic substances, such as nitric acid, etc. It remains
always tenacious, being therefore suitable for cementing
bodies exposed to repeated shocks.</p>

<p><i>Hard rubber cement.</i> Rubber, 150 parts; tallow, 10; red
lead, 10.</p>

<p>This cement is prepared in the same manner as the above.
The addition of red lead gives it a red color, and solidifies
it in a short time to a mass as hard as stone.</p>

<p><i>Elastic cement.</i> Carbon disulphide, 8 ozs.; fine rubber,
1 oz.; isinglass, 4 drachms; gutta-percha, 1 oz. Dissolve
the solids in the fluid.</p>

<p>This cement is used for cementing leather and rubber.
For use the leather is roughened and a thin coat of the
cement applied and allowed to dry completely; then the
two surfaces to be joined are warmed and placed together
and allowed to dry.</p>

<p><i>Marine glue.</i> This cement, which is only a glue in name,
is water-proof, and can be used to cement metal, wood, glass,
stone, pasteboard, etc., and is especially adapted for caulking
vessels.</p>

<p>Suspend 10 parts of rubber inclosed in a bag in a vessel
containing 120 parts of refined petroleum, so that only half
of the bag is immersed, and allow it to remain ten to fourteen
days in a warm place. Then melt 20 parts of asphalt
in an iron boiler and add the rubber solution in a thin jet,
and heat the mixture, while constantly stirring, until it is
perfectly homogeneous. Pour it into greased metallic
moulds, where it forms into dark-brown or black plates
difficult to break. In using it, it should be melted in a
kettle placed in boiling water to prevent its burning, which
it is very apt to do, as it is a bad conductor of heat. After
it has been liquefied remove the kettle from the water and
place it over a fire, where it can be heated, if necessary, to
make it more fluid, to 302° F., carefully stirring it to prevent
burning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span></p>

<p>If possible, the surfaces to be glued together should be
heated to 212° F., as the glue can then be slowly applied.
The thinner the layer of glue in cementing together smooth
surfaces, the better will it adhere. But a somewhat thicker
layer is required for rough surfaces, for instance, boards not
planed, the excess of glue being forced out by strong pressure.
Generally speaking, it is best to subject all articles
cemented together with marine glue to as strong a pressure
as possible until the glue is congealed.</p>

<p>Repeated experiments have shown that with the aid of
this cement square vats perfectly water-tight can be constructed
of boards. Wooden pegs dipped in the compound
should be used for putting the vats together.</p>

<p><i>Jeffrey’s marine glue.</i> Dissolve 1 part of rubber in benzine,
and mix the solution with 2 parts of shellac by the
assistance of heat.</p>

<p><i>Another formula</i> is as follows: Coal naphtha 1 quart,
rubber cut in shreds 2 ozs. Macerate for 10 or 12 days and
then rub smooth with a spatula on a slab; add 2 parts by
weight of shellac to 1 part of this solution. To use the
compound melt it at about 240° F.</p>

<p><i>Marine glue for damp walls.</i> Rubber 10 parts, whiting
10, oil of turpentine 20, carbon disulphide 10, rosin 5 and
asphalt 5. Dissolve the ingredients in a suitable vessel and
stand in a warm place, shaking it frequently.</p>

<p>Scrape the wall smooth and clean, and apply the glue
with a broad brush on the damp place and about 8 inches
higher than the line of dampness. Before the glue is dry
lay on plain paper which will adhere tightly. On this
plain paper the wall paper can be pasted in the usual manner.
If carefully done, the wall paper will always remain
dry.</p>


<h4>GUTTA-PERCHA CEMENTS.</h4>

<p><i>Cement for leather.</i> Gutta-percha 100 parts, pitch or
asphalt 100, oil of turpentine 15.</p>

<p>This cement should be used hot. It is suitable for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
cementing all kinds of substances, but adheres particularly
well to leather.</p>

<p><i>Cement for hard rubber combs.</i> <i>A.</i> Prepare a very thick
solution of bleached gutta-percha in bisulphide of carbon.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Dissolve sulphur in bisulphide of carbon.</p>

<p>The cementing is effected by applying solution <i>A</i> to the
fractured surfaces and pressing them together. When dry
brush solution <i>B</i> over the cemented place.</p>

<p><i>Elastic gutta-percha cement.</i> Dissolve 10 parts of gutta-percha
in 100 of benzine, then pour the clear solution into
a bottle containing 100 parts of linseed-oil varnish and
unite both by shaking. This cement excels in elasticity,
and is especially suitable for attaching the soles of shoes, as
it is so elastic that it will not break, no matter how much it
is bent. To make it adhere tightly roughen the leather on
the side to be cemented.</p>

<p><i>Cement for horses’ hoofs.</i> For filling cracks and fissures
in horses’ hoofs a cement is required which possesses great
resistance to the action of water combined with elasticity
and solidity. A mass answering all demands consists of 10
parts by weight of gum ammoniac and 20 to 25 of purified
gutta-percha. Heat the gutta-percha to between 194° and
212° F., and then work it with the finely powdered gum
ammoniac to a homogeneous mass. In using it, soften the
cement by heating, and after carefully cleansing the crack
in the hoof, apply it with a heated knife. The cement
solidifies immediately after cooling to the ordinary temperature,
and becomes soon so hard as to allow of nails being
driven into it.</p>

<p><i>Cement for crockery.</i> Gutta-percha 1 part, shellac 1.</p>

<p>Place the two ingredients in an earthenware jar, and
melt the two together by standing this jar on a vessel of
boiling water, or else one filled with hot sand, the vessel
holding the water or sand being heated over a fire or gas
furnace. Stir the melted ingredients well together. The
resulting cement is one possessing great hardness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
toughness, which suits it admirably for mending crockery.
Warm the edges to be joined together, smear the cement on,
join together, and hold the article thus joined until cool.</p>

<p><i>Cement for leather.</i> Mix 10 parts of carbon disulphide
with 1 part of turpentine, and then add sufficient gutta percha
to make a tough, thickly-fluid mass. Before using
this cement, free the surface to be joined from grease. To
effect this, sprinkle a little bicarbonate of soda, carbonate of
ammonia or borax on the surfaces to be joined, lay a cloth
over them, and then place a hot iron on top, and keep it
there a short time so as to cause the alkali to cut the grease,
then put the cement on both surfaces to be joined, put them
together and subject to pressure until they are cemented.</p>

<p>Gutta percha dissolved in carbon disulphide to the consistency
of syrup is also a good cement for joining leather.
The parts to be joined should be well covered with cement
so as to fill the pores of the leather, then the cement is
heated and the parts hammered until the cement is cold.</p>


<h4>CASEINE CEMENTS.</h4>

<p><i>Preparation of pure caseine.</i> Although the caseine contained
in old cheese can be used, the other constituents,
such as fat, salt, and free acid, exert an injurious influence
upon the solidity of the cement prepared with it. It is,
therefore, best to prepare pure caseine, which is easily
accomplished in the following manner:</p>

<p>Put milk in a cool place, and after taking off the cream
as long as any is formed, remove the skimmed milk to a
warm place to coagulate. After heating the curd, place it
upon a filter and wash the caseine remaining upon the
filter with rainwater until the water running off shows no
trace of acid.</p>

<p>To remove the last traces of fat tie the washed caseine in
a cloth and after boiling it in water, spread it upon blotting
paper in a warm place to dry. It will shrivel up to a
horny mass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

<p>When thoroughly dried pure caseine will keep for a long
time without suffering alteration. To obtain the caseine in
a form suitable for preparing cements it is only necessary
to pour water over a corresponding quantity and allow it
to stand for some time. Caseine combines with lime to a
hard insoluble mass.</p>

<p>Ordinary technical caseine may be readily and cheaply
prepared as follows: Skim milk is heated in a copper boiler,
if necessary by the introduction of steam, to 122° F. Then
add for every 1000 quarts of milk, 3 quarts of crude hydrochloric
acid diluted with 5 to 6 times the quantity of water.
After coagulation, the whey is drained off, the curd spread
out upon an inclined table and allowed to cool. The curd
is then washed by pouring cold water over it through a
rose, or stirring it up with water in a barrel, allowing to
settle, and pouring off the supernatant water. The residue
is subjected to moderate pressure. The caseine while still
moist is comminuted in a curd-mill and packed in bags.
In this state it must be worked at once, as otherwise it
spoils readily and is attacked by worms. If it is to be kept
for a longer time, it has to be dried. This is effected by
spreading it out upon linen cloths and placing it in a drying
chamber.</p>

<p>In this manner 8.5 per cent. of moist, or 3.5 per cent. of
dry, caseine is obtained which is brought into commerce as
technical caseine or lactarine. It being insoluble in water,
10 per cent. of an alkali—soda, borax, or ammonia—has to
be added to effect solution. Water-soluble caseine is seldom
found in commerce, the consumer preparing it, as a rule,
himself.</p>

<p>A purer technical caseine is obtained according to John
A. Just’s method as follows: Dissolve, stirring constantly,
in 115 quarts of water heated to between 104° and 131° F.,
17 to 26 ozs. of bicarbonate of soda and 176 lbs. of moist, or
118 lbs. of dry, caseine, and dry the solution upon a heated
revolving metal cylinder. After each revolution of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
cylinder, the dry material is scraped off with brushes and
by being forced through a fine-meshed sieve yields soluble
caseine powder.</p>

<p><i>Caseine cement which can be kept for a long time.</i> Convert
into powder, each by itself, 200 parts of caseine, 40 of
burned lime, and 1 of camphor. Mix the powders intimately
and keep the mixture in an air-tight bottle. For
use, mix some of the powder with the requisite quantity
of water and use the cement at once.</p>

<p><i>Cement for glass.</i> Old dry cheese 100 parts, water 50,
slaked lime 20.</p>

<p>Free the cheese from rind, and rub it with the water
until a homogeneous mass drawing threads is formed.
Then stir in quickly the lime powder, and use the cement
at once. It unites not only glass to glass, but can also be
used for cementing metal to glass.</p>

<p><i>Cement for metals.</i> Elutriated quartz sand, 10 parts;
caseine, 8; slaked lime, 10, and sufficient water to form a
cream-like mass.</p>

<p><i>Cement for porcelain.</i> Caseine dissolves readily in solution
of water-glass, and forms then one of the best cements
for porcelain known. To prepare it, fill a bottle one-quarter
full with fresh caseine, and after filling the bottle
with solution of water-glass, effect the solution of the caseine
by frequent shaking.</p>

<p><i>Cement for meerschaum.</i> Dissolve caseine in water-glass,
and after stirring quickly finely-pulverized calcined magnesia
into the mass, use it at once, as it solidifies very soon.
By adding, besides magnesia, genuine meerschaum finely
pulverized, a mass closely resembling meerschaum is obtained,
which can be used for manufacturing imitation
meerschaum.</p>

<p><i>Cement for wood, etc.</i> Rub 10 parts of caseine and 5 of
borax to a thick, milky mass, and use it like glue. This
cement can be advantageously used for pasting labels upon
wine bottles, as it neither moulds nor becomes detached in
the cellar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<p><i>Another formula</i> is as follows: Dissolve borax by boiling
in water, and pour the solution over fresh caseine. The
result will be a clear, thick mass of extraordinary power of
adhesion, which can be kept for any length of time without
suffering decomposition.</p>

<p>Applied to leather, paper, linen or cotton goods, it forms
a coat of beautiful lustre, and for this reason is much used
in the manufacture of fancy articles of paper and leather.</p>

<p><i>Cement for porcelain.</i> Dissolve 10 parts of caseine in 60
of water-glass solution. Apply the cement quickly and dry
the cemented articles in the air.</p>


<h4>WATER-GLASS AND WATER-GLASS CEMENTS.</h4>

<p><i>Water-glass.</i> Water-glass (silicate of soda or soluble
glass) is found in commerce as a thickly-fluid, tenacious
mass. It is generally prepared by fusing 15 parts of quartz
sand with 8 of carbonate of soda and 1 of charcoal. The
silicic acid combining with the soda disengages the carbonic
acid, the expulsion of which is facilitated by the presence
of charcoal, which converts it into carbonic oxide. It
dissolves readily in water. The solution has a strongly
alkaline taste, and possesses the property of being gradually
converted, on exposure to the air, to a gelatinous mass
which finally solidifies. For this reason water-glass should
be kept in bottles hermetically closed with corks. Glass
stoppers are of no use, as they are so firmly cemented to the
bottle that on attempting to open the latter the neck breaks
off.</p>

<p>By combining water-glass with cement or burned lime
the resulting mass solidifies quite rapidly to a mass as hard
as stone, and generally capable of resisting chemical action.</p>

<p>Water-glass by itself is only fit for cementing glass to
glass, but combined with other substances it furnishes very
durable and solid cements.</p>

<p><i>Cement for cracked bottles.</i> Select a cork which will fit the
bottle air-tight and place it loosely upon the bottle, and heat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
the latter gradually to at least 212° F. Then press the
cork down and apply a thick solution of water-glass to the
cracks. In cooling, the air in the bottle contracts strongly,
and the pressure of the exterior air drives the water-glass
with great force into the cracks closing them entirely so
that they cannot be detected.</p>

<p><i>Cement for glass and porcelain.</i> Stir quickly together 10
parts of elutriated glass meal, 20 of powdered fluor spar,
and 60 of water-glass solution, and apply the homogeneous
paste at once. In a few days the cement will be so hard
that the cemented vessels can be heated without danger.</p>

<p><i>Cement for hydraulic works.</i> Finely powdered cement, and
solution of water-glass. Mix the two bodies quickly together.</p>

<p>As this cement hardens very quickly, it should be used
fresh. It hardens under water, and is therefore excellent
for hydraulic works. The stones should be coated with
a solution of water-glass before applying the cement.</p>

<p><i>Cement for uniting metals.</i> A strong cement, which
hardens rapidly, is made by stirring the finest whiting in a
solution of soda-glass of 33° B., made so as to form a plastic
mass. This can be readily colored to any desired shade.
The addition of sifted sulphide of antimony gives a black
cement, which by polishing acquires a metallic lustre; iron
filings render it grayish-black; zinc dust turns it green, but
after polishing, it appears like metallic zinc, and may be
employed for the permanent repair of zinc ornaments, etc.
Carbonate of copper imparts a light green shade. Other
additions may be made, as oxide of chrome for dark green,
cobalt blue for blue, red lead for orange, vermilion for
scarlet, carmine for violet, etc.</p>

<p><i>Cement for tightening joints of pipes exposed to a red heat.</i>
Mix 80 parts of pyrolusite, 100 of zinc white, and 20 of
water-glass.</p>

<p>This cement fuses at a temperature not too high, and
then forms a glass-like mass which adheres very firmly and
closely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

<p><i>Cement for marble and alabaster.</i> The point of fracture of
articles cemented with the following mixture is difficult to
find, and the cemented place is much stronger than the
material itself. Mix 12 parts of Portland cement, 6 of
slaked lime, 6 of fine sand, and 1 of infusorial earth with
sufficient water-glass to form a thick paste. The article to
be cemented need not be heated. It hardens in twenty-four
hours.</p>


<h4>GLYCERINE AND GLYCERINE CEMENTS.</h4>

<p>Commercial glycerine is a yellowish or nearly colorless
and more or less viscid liquid having an intensely sweet
taste. In combination with lead oxide and intimately
worked into it, by heating and stamping, it furnishes very
strong and durable cements deserving general introduction,
though thus far they have been but little used.</p>

<p>For the manufacture of cements the use of pure odorless
glycerine is not required, the yellow crude article, which is
much cheaper, answering all purposes. The principal
point is to use very highly concentrated glycerine, as otherwise
the cements prepared with it solidify very slowly and
besides do not possess a proper degree of hardness and
solidity.</p>

<p>It is of especial importance to have the lead oxide free
from water. To accomplish this, heat it thoroughly and
mix it with the glycerine while still hot. Cement thus
prepared solidifies very quickly, and can be used for many
purposes. It is an excellent material for quickly joining
the stones of submarine works.</p>

<p><i>Glycerine and litharge cement.</i> Moisten elutriated litharge
with glycerine so that a thin homogeneous paste is
formed. This cement is adapted for uniting the joints of
steam pipes, cementing wood, glass, porcelain, and also
glass upon metal, etc. It solidifies to a very hard mass in
a quarter to three-quarters of an hour. Before applying
the cement coat the surfaces to be joined with pure
glycerine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span></p>


<h4>LIME CEMENTS.</h4>

<p>Quick lime, slaked lime and chalk are used for this purpose.
Quick lime, which is obtained by burning limestone,
combines gradually with the fats to insoluble lime soaps.
Slaked lime, which consists of a combination of lime with
water, acts in the same manner.</p>

<p>For the preparation of cements the lime is slaked by
placing it in a dish and pouring as much water over it as
it will absorb. Good lime, technically called <i>fat lime</i>,
should eagerly combine with water, evolving much heat,
swelling greatly, and crumbling to a light white powder.</p>

<p>Quick lime exposed to the air until, by the absorption of
moisture and carbonic acid, it is converted into a powder is
called <i>air-slaked</i>.</p>

<p>Cements prepared with quick lime will, as a rule, solidify
more quickly than those prepared with air-slaked lime.</p>

<p>Chalk is a carbonate of lime consisting of the shells of
microscopic animals, and can be readily pulverized and
elutriated. In the latter state it is known as <i>whiting</i>. For
the preparation of entirely white cements the use of pure
white lime or chalk is absolutely necessary. Yellow or
reddish lime contains oxide of iron, and furnishes cements
of the same tinge.</p>

<p><i>Cement for glass.</i> Litharge 30 parts, quick lime 20, linseed-oil
varnish 5.</p>

<p><i>Cement for joiners.</i> A cement for filling up cracks and
holes is obtained by mixing slaked lime 50 parts, flour 100,
linseed-oil varnish 15.</p>

<p><i>Cement for cracked clay crucibles and porcelain.</i> By applying
to the cracks a mixture of 10 parts of slaked lime, 10
of borax, and 5 of litharge in sufficient water to form a stiff
paste, and drying after heating the crucible, the cracked
places will be united so firmly that the crucible, when
thrown to the ground, will generally break in any other
place than the cemented one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p>

<p>This cement can also be used for porcelain capable of
standing a strong heat.</p>

<p><i>Lime and glue cement.</i> Stir air-slaked lime into hot glue.
This cement is especially suitable for attaching metal to
glass. It forms a very hard yellowish-brown mass.</p>


<h4>GYPSUM CEMENTS.</h4>

<p>Sulphate of lime in combination with water is met with
in nature, both in the form of transparent prisms of <i>selenite</i>,
and in opaque and semi-opaque masses, known as <i>alabaster</i>
and <i>gypsum</i>. By pulverizing the latter and heating to
about 302° F. it loses its water, and is converted into
anhydrous gypsum or <i>plaster of Paris</i>, which on mixing
with water recombines with it to form a mass of hydrated
sulphate of lime, the hardness of which nearly equals that
of the original gypsum. When the powder is mixed with
water to a cream and poured into a mould, the minute particles
of anhydrous sulphate of lime combine with the
water to reproduce the original gypsum, and this act of
combination is attended with a slight expansion which
forces the plaster into the finest lines of the mould.</p>

<p>By using a solution of alum instead of ordinary water, a
plaster is obtained which, although it takes much longer to
set than the ordinary kind, is much harder, and therefore
takes a good polish.</p>

<p>For preparing cements only perfectly white plaster of
Paris should be used, as the gray article possesses but little
adhesive power.</p>

<p><i>Cement for plaster of Paris statues.</i> To repair plaster of
Paris statues so that the point of fracture cannot be detected,
proceed in the following manner:</p>

<p>Moisten the fractured surfaces with water by means of a
brush until they absorb no more and remain moist. Mix
plaster of Paris with water to a thin cream and stir until
the heat appearing at first has ceased, which will prevent
the conversion of the plaster into a solid coherent mass.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
Apply quickly a thin layer of the plaster to one of the fractured
surfaces, press the other against it until the plaster
has set, and, when dry, carefully remove the excess by
scraping.</p>

<p><i>Cement for glass and porcelain.</i> Mix quickly 50 parts of
plaster of Paris, 10 of quick lime, and 20 of white of egg.
Use at once, as the cement solidifies very rapidly.</p>

<p><i>Cement for iron and stone.</i> A very useful cement for
securing iron railing in stone is obtained by mixing 30
parts of plaster of Paris, 10 of iron filings and 20 of vinegar.</p>

<p><i>Cements for porcelain.</i> I. Mix plaster of Paris with saturated
solution of alum to a cream. After moistening the
fractured surfaces apply a thin layer of the cement, press
the surfaces together, wrap a wire or cord tightly around
them, and let the article stand quietly for a few weeks.
The cement is converted into a mass as hard as stone.</p>

<p>II. Mix plaster of Paris with a thick, clear solution of
gum arabic and cement the articles as soon as possible.
Although this cement adheres very tightly, porcelain vessels
cemented with it cannot be used for liquids.</p>

<p><i>Universal plaster of Paris cement.</i> Mix 21 parts of plaster
of Paris, 3 of iron filings, 10 of water, and 4 of white of
egg. This cement is suitable for attaching metal to glass,
metal to stone, etc.</p>


<h4>IRON CEMENTS.</h4>

<p><i>Heat-resisting cement.</i> Clay 10 parts, iron filings 5, vinegar
2, water 3.</p>

<p><i>Water and steam-proof cement.</i> Iron filings 100 parts, sal-ammoniac
2, water 10.</p>

<p>This cement rusts very much in a few days, and is converted
into an extremely solid mass which is perfectly
steam- and water-proof.</p>

<p><i>Cement for iron.</i> Mix 65 parts of wrought-iron filings,
2.5 of sal ammoniac, and 1.5 of flowers of sulphur, and then
add 1 part of sulphuric acid diluted with sufficient water to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
form a stiff paste. This cement solidifies in two to three
days, and rusts, with the parts of iron to be cemented, to an
extraordinarily durable mass.</p>

<p><i>Fire-proof cement for iron pipes.</i> Wrought-iron filings 45
parts, clay 20, fire-clay 15, common salt solution 8.</p>

<p><i>Cements resisting high temperatures.</i> 1. Iron filings 20
parts, clay powder 45, borax 5, common salt 5, pyrolusite
10.</p>

<p>Dissolve the borax and common salt in the water, add
and mix quickly the clay powder, pyrolusite, and iron
filings. Apply the cement at once. Exposed to a white
heat, it hardens to a tightly adhering, glassy mass.</p>

<p>2. Mix 52 parts of pyrolusite, 25 of zinc white, and 5 of
borax with solution of water-glass to a paste, and use at
once. This cement requires to be gradually dried. It will
stand the highest temperatures.</p>

<p><i>Cement for filling in defects in castings.</i> Stir 100 parts of
iron filings free from rust with sufficient water to form a
thick paste, and press the mixture into the fissures, cracks,
etc. The cement becomes solid only after the iron filings
become strongly rusted. To free the ingredients from
adhering fat, wash them, before mixing, in liquid ammonia.</p>

<p><i>Cement for cracked stove plates, etc.</i> Knead 20 parts of iron
filings, 12 of iron scale, 30 of plaster of Paris, and 10 of
common salt with blood to a stiff paste, and use at once.
Instead of blood, water-glass can be used, it having the advantage
of being odorless on strong heating, while blood
cement evolves a disagreeable odor.</p>

<p><i>Cement for iron water tanks.</i> Knead iron filings with
vinegar to paste. Allow the mixture to stand until it turns
brown, and then force it into the joints by means of a
chisel.</p>

<p><i>Cement for cracked iron pots.</i> Knead 10 parts of iron
filings and 60 of clay with linseed oil to a thick paste.
Before applying it add a little linseed oil, and allow it to
dry slowly. In a few weeks the cement will be so hard
that the vessels can be used without danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span></p>

<p><i>Black cement for stoves.</i> Iron filings 10 parts, sand 12,
bone black 10, slaked lime 12, glue water 5.</p>

<p><i>Cements for iron stoves.</i> 1. Pulverize as finely as possible
and mix intimately 4 to 5 parts of clay, 2 of iron filings
free from rust, 1 of pyrolusite, ½ of common salt, and ½ of
borax with water to a paste, and apply the cement quickly
to the places to be cemented and allow it to dry slowly.
This cement will stand a white heat, and resist the action
of boiling water.</p>

<p>2. Mix intimately and as quickly as possible 1 part of
pulverized pyrolusite, and 1 of zinc white with solution of
water-glass to a plastic mass, which solidifies quickly. The
power of resistance of this cement, it is claimed, is not inferior
to No. 1, though experiments have proved No. 1 to
be preferable.</p>


<h4>CEMENTS FOR CHEMICAL APPARATUS.</h4>

<p>Cements to be used for the above purpose must possess
various properties difficult to combine in one preparation.
They must be gas-proof, and capable of resisting the action
of different vapors and acid fluids. As regards resistance
to the action of chemical agents, there is nothing better
than caoutchouc, but unfortunately it can only be used for
tightening chemical apparatus not exposed to a high temperature.</p>

<p>In chemical laboratories bran of almonds, either by itself
or kneaded with water to a thick paste, is frequently used,
or rye or wheat bran mixed with a little flour and water.
These cements, though very suitable for cementing glass
distilling apparatus, are strongly acted upon by chlorine
and the vapors of nitric acid.</p>

<p>For small apparatus to be used for the development of
fluoric acid, plaster of Paris mixed with a little water can
be used as a cement. To make the joint entirely gas-tight,
paste a strip of paper over it. Although this cement does
not resist the action of fluoric acid for any length of time, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
suffices generally for the protection of the Workmen during
the time the development of the acid is in progress, as, for
instance, in chemical analyses, etc.</p>

<p>To cement chemical apparatus exposed to a temperature
not exceeding 86° to 104° F. paraffine does excellent service;
as it possesses the power of resisting the action of the
strongest acids and alkalies.</p>

<p>Below will be found a few receipts for cements which
have proved reliable.</p>

<p><i>Linseed oil and clay cement.</i> Knead 10 parts of dry clay
with 1 of linseed oil to a homogeneous mass. This cement
will stand heating to the boiling-point of mercury.</p>

<p><i>Linseed oil, zinc and manganese cement.</i> Knead 10 parts
of pyrolusite, 20 of zinc white, and 40 of clay with sufficient
boiled linseed oil (not exceeding 7 parts) to a plastic
mass. This cement will stand a somewhat higher temperature
than the preceding one.</p>

<p><i>Cements resisting very high temperatures.</i> I. Clay 100
parts, powdered glass 2.</p>

<p>The glass melts on exposure to great heat and slags the
clay to a hard mass. The same effect is produced by adding
small quantities of soda and borax to the clay. An
admixture of chalk and boric acid, as in the following receipt,
also gives excellent results.</p>

<p>II. Clay 100 parts, chalk 2, boric acid 3.</p>

<p><i>Cement resisting acids.</i> Melt rubber with double the
quantity of linseed oil, and then knead in sufficient bole to
form a paste. This cement resists the action of nitric and
hydrochloric acids, and can be advantageously used for
closing bottles containing them. As it solidifies very
slowly, it can readily be detached from the bottles, and
used again.</p>

<p>For cement which is to solidify quickly on exposure to
the air, add a few per cent. by weight of red lead or
litharge.</p>

<p><i>Rubber cement for chemical apparatus.</i> Cut 8 parts of rub<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>ber
in small pieces and throw them gradually into a mixture
of 2 parts of tallow and 16 of linseed oil previously
strongly heated. After effecting an intimate mixture of
the constituents by vigorous and constant stirring, add 3
parts of white bole.</p>

<p>Although this cement does not stand a high temperature,
it possesses an extraordinary power of resisting the action
of acid vapors.</p>

<p><i>Scheibler’s cement for chemical apparatus.</i> Melt together 1
part of wax and 3 of shellac, and work into the mixture 2
parts of gutta-percha cut up in very small pieces. This
cement will bear considerable heat without actually melting.</p>


<h4>CEMENTS FOR SPECIAL PURPOSES.</h4>

<p><i>Cement for attaching metal letters to glass, marble, wood, etc.</i>
Dissolve over a water-bath 5 parts of glue in a mixture of
15 parts of copal varnish, 5 parts of boiled linseed oil, 3
parts of crude oil of turpentine, and 2 parts of rectified oil
of turpentine, and add 10 parts of slaked lime to the
mixture.</p>

<p><i>Cement for joints of iron pipes.</i> Mix 5 lbs. of coarsely
powdered iron borings, 2 ozs. of powdered sal ammoniac,
and 1 oz. of sulphur with sufficient water to form a paste.
This composition hardens rapidly, but if time can be
allowed it sets more firmly without the sulphur. It must
be used as soon as mixed, and rammed tightly into the
joint.</p>

<p>Another receipt is as follows:</p>

<p>Mix 2 ozs. of sal ammoniac, 1 oz. of sublimated sulphur
and 1 lb. of cast-iron filings or fine turnings in a mortar,
and keep the powder dry. When it is to be used, mix it
with 20 times its weight of clean iron turnings or filings
and grind the whole in a mortar; then wet it with water
until it becomes of convenient consistency, when it is to be
applied to the joint. After a time it becomes as hard and
strong as the metal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>

<p><i>Steam boiler cement.</i> Mix 10 parts of finely-powdered
litharge with 1 part of fine sand and 1 part of air-slaked
lime. The mixture may be kept for any length of time
without deterioration. For use a portion of it is made into
a paste with linseed oil or, better, boiled linseed oil. In
this state it must be applied quickly, as it soon becomes
hard.</p>

<p><i>Cement for rubber.</i> Powdered shellac is softened in 10
times its weight of strong water of ammonia, whereby a
transparent mass is obtained, which becomes fluid after
keeping some little time without the use of hot water. In
three to four weeks the mixture is perfectly liquid, and
when applied it will be found to soften the rubber. As
soon as the ammonia evaporates it hardens again, and thus
becomes impervious both to gases and to liquids. For
cementing sheet rubber, or rubber material in any shape,
to metal, glass, and other smooth surfaces, this cement is
highly recommended.</p>

<p><i>Cement for tires.</i> 1. Isinglass 1 oz., gutta-percha 1 oz.,
rubber 2 ozs., carbon disulphide 8 fluid ozs. Mix and dissolve.</p>

<p>2. Shellac 4 ozs., gutta-percha 4 ozs., red lead and sulphur,
each ½ oz. Melt the shellac and gutta-percha, and
add with constant stirring the red lead and sulphur, melted.
Use while hot.</p>

<p>3. Crude rubber 1 oz., carbon disulphide 8 ozs. Macerate
24 hours, and then add a solution of:</p>

<p>Rosin 2 ozs., beeswax ½ oz., carbon disulphide 8 ozs.</p>

<p>4. Rubber 20 parts, rosin 10, Venetian red 10, tallow
5. Melt the rubber over a fire, then add the rosin and the
tallow and finally the Venetian red.</p>

<p><i>Cement for steam pipes, etc.</i> A cement of specially valuable
properties for steam pipes, in filling up small leaks,
such as a blow-hole in a casting, without the necessity of
removing the injured piece, is composed of 5 lbs. Paris
white and 5 lbs. yellow ochre, 10 lbs. litharge, 5 lbs. red<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
lead and 4 lbs. black oxide of manganese. Mix the materials
thoroughly and make into a paste with a small quantity
of asbestos and boiled linseed oil. The composition, as
thus prepared, will harden in from 2 to 5 hours, and has
the advantage of not being subject to expansion and contraction
to such an extent as to cause a leakage afterwards,
and its efficiency in places difficult of access is of special
importance.</p>

<p><i>Cement for marble.</i> Stir to a thick batter with silicate of
soda 12 parts of Portland cement, 6 of slaked lime, 6 of fine
white lead and 1 of infusorial earth. This is excellent for
marble and alabaster. The cemented objects need to be
heated. After 24 hours the fracture is firm, and the place
can scarcely be found.</p>

<p><i>Cement for attaching wood, glass, etc., to metal.</i> Acetate of
lead 23 parts by weight, alum 23, gum arabic 38, wheat
flour 250.</p>

<p>Dissolve the acetate of lead and the alum in a little
water and separately dissolve the gum arabic in a fair
quantity of boiling water. Thus if the 250 parts of wheat
flour represent half a pound, the quantity of water needed
will be about a pint. The gum having dissolved, add the
flour, put the whole on the fire, stir well with a wooden
stick, then add the solution of lead acetate and alum. Continue
the stirring in order to avoid the formation of lumps,
then take it off the fire without allowing it to boil. This
cement is used cold, and will not scale. It is very useful
in making wood, glass, cardboard, etc., adhere to metal,
and is extremely strong.</p>

<p><i>Brushmakers’ cement.</i> Rosin 5 lbs., rosin oil or spirit 1
quart.</p>

<p>Reduce the rosin to small pieces, run down in a pot, add
the other ingredient, and stir until mixed and syrupy, then
run out into tins. It is used for cementing the bristles in
the stocks, also for string binding on sash tools, etc.</p>

<p><i>Cement for electrical apparatus.</i> Mix together 1 lb. of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
beeswax added to 5 lbs. of rosin, 1 lb. of red ochre, and 2
tablespoonfuls of plaster of Paris. It will make an excellent
composition for electrical apparatus.</p>

<p>A cheaper composition for cementing voltaic plates into
wooden troughs is made with 6 lbs. of plaster of Paris and
¼ pint of linseed oil. The ochre and the plaster of Paris
should be well dried and added to the other ingredients
when these are in a melted state.</p>

<p><i>Jewelers’ cement.</i> Dissolve over the water-bath 25 parts
of fish glue in a small quantity of strong spirits of wine,
add 2 parts of gum ammoniac; separately dissolve 1 part
of mastic in 5 of spirits of wine. Mix the two solutions
and keep them in well-stoppered bottles.</p>

<p><i>American cement for jewelers.</i> Soak 4 ozs. of isinglass in
2 lbs. of water for 24 hours, then evaporate in the water-bath;
to 1 lb. add 1 lb. of rectified spirits of wine, and
strain. Then mix in a solution of 2 ozs. of mastic and 1
oz. of gum ammoniac in 16 ozs. of rectified spirit.</p>

<p><i>Cement for celluloid.</i> Shellac 2 ozs., spirits of camphor 2,
90 per cent. alcohol 6 to 8.</p>

<p><i>Stratena.</i> This well-known household cement is said to
be prepared as follows: Dissolve 12 parts of white glue in
16 of acetic acid, and then add this solution to one of 2
parts gelatine in 16 of water. After mixing add 2 parts
shellac varnish.</p>

<p><i>Cement for cloth.</i> Gutta-percha 16 parts, rubber 4, pitch
2, shellac 1, linseed oil 2 pints. Dissolve the whole by
heat, stirring constantly.</p>


<h4>HOW TO USE CEMENTS.</h4>

<p>It is unquestionably true that quite as much depends
upon the manner in which a cement is applied, as upon the
cement itself. The best cement that was ever compounded
would prove entirely worthless improperly applied. In
the foregoing a number of cements have been given which
answer every reasonable demand when properly prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
and properly used. Good common glue will unite two
pieces of wood so firmly that the fibres will part from
each other rather than from the cementing material; two
pieces of glass can be so joined that they will part anywhere
rather than on the line of union; glass can be united
to metal, metal to metal, stone to stone, and all so strongly
that the joint will certainly not be the weakest part of the
resulting mass. What are the rules to be observed in
effecting these results?</p>

<p>The first point that demands attention is to bring the
cement itself into intimate contact with the surface to be
united. If glue is employed, the surface should be made
so warm that the melted glue will not be chilled before it
has time to effect a thorough adhesion. The same is more
eminently true in regard to cements that are used in a fused
state, such as mixtures of resins, shellac, and similar
materials. These matters will not adhere to any substance
unless the latter has been heated to nearly or quite the
fusing point of the cement used. This fact was quite
familiar to those who used sealing-wax in the olden days
of seals. When the seal was used, in succession, rapidly so
as to become heated, the sealing-wax stuck to it with a
firmness that was annoying, so much so that the impression
was generally destroyed, from the simple fact that the
sealing-wax would rather part in its own substance than at
the point of adhesion to the seal. Sealing-wax or ordinary
so-called electric cement is a very good agent for uniting
metal to glass or stone, provided the masses to be united
are made so hot as to fuse the cement; but if the cement is
applied to them while they are cold, it will not stick at all.
This fact is well known to those itinerant venders of cement
for uniting earthenware. By heating two pieces of delf so
that they will fuse shellac, they are able to smear them
with a little of this gum and join them so that they will
rather break at any other part than along the line of union.
But although people see the operation constantly performed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
and buy liberally of the cement, it will be found that in
nine cases out of ten, the cement proves worthless in the
hands of the purchasers, simply because they do not know
how to use it. They are afraid to heat a delicate glass or
porcelain vessel to a sufficient degree, and they are apt to
use too much of the material, and the result is a failure.</p>

<p>The great obstacles to the junction of any two surfaces
are air and dirt. The former is universally present, while
the latter is due to accident or carelessness. All surfaces
are covered with a thin adhering layer of air, which it is
difficult to remove, and which, although it may at first
sight seem improbable, bears a relation to the outer surface
of most bodies different from that maintained by the air a
few lines away. The reality of the existence of this adhering
layer of air is well known to all who are familiar with
electrotype manipulation. It is also seen in the case of
highly polished metals which may be immersed in water
without becoming wet. Unless this adhering layer of air
is displaced, the cement cannot adhere to the surface to
which it is applied because it cannot come in contact with
it. The most efficient agent in displacing this air is heat.
Metals warmed to a point a little above 203° F. become
instantly and completely wet when immersed in water.
Hence, for cements that are used in a fused condition, heat
is the most efficient means of bringing them in contact with
the surfaces to which they are to be applied. Another very
important point is to use as little cement as possible.
When the surfaces are separated by a large mass of cement
we have to depend upon the strength of the cement itself
and not upon its adhesion to the surfaces which it is used
to join; and, in general, cements are comparatively brittle.</p>

<p>The cement forced out of the joint by pressing the surfaces
together should be removed while the cement is in a
fused state or liquid. This can generally be effected by
wiping the surplus off, while after solidification a certain
amount of force has to be used which may frequently break
the joint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span></p>

<p>Oil cements, which generally solidify slowly, have the
advantage of being water-proof. In cementing with oil
cements, coat the surfaces to be joined with linseed oil, or,
still better, boiled linseed oil, but in working with resinous
cements apply oil of turpentine, spirit of wine, or a fluid
which will readily dissolve the cementing constituent of the
cement.</p>

<p>For cleansing the surfaces from grease and dirt place the
articles in strong lye and rinse off in clean water without
touching the surfaces with the hands. For painted porcelain
articles which cannot be placed in lye, it is recommended
to brush the surfaces several times with carbon
disulphide.</p>


<h4>PASTES AND MUCILAGES.</h4>

<p><i>Preparation of paste.</i> Ordinary paste is prepared either
from flour or starch, and according to the raw material
used in its preparation, may, therefore, be divided into
starch and flour paste.</p>

<p>Starch is an indispensable constituent of certain parts of
plants, and plays an important part in the nutrition of the
plant. It is chiefly manufactured from potatoes, Indian
corn and grain. Examined under the microscope, it is
seen to be composed of small granules consisting of layers
placed one above the other.</p>

<p><i>Starch paste.</i> In stirring starch with water to a thin
paste and gradually heating it, it will be observed that at a
temperature between 140° and 158° F. a peculiar change
takes place; the thin milk-white liquid becomes transparent,
opalizes, and at the same time becomes thickly fluid,
in short, the starch is converted into paste. During this
process the separate layers of the starch granules become
detached somewhat in the same manner as an opening bud,
whereby they absorb water, and the peculiar mass, called
paste, is formed. That paste is not a solution is easily
proved by the fact that on attempting to filter starch-paste<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
only water drains off, while the starch remains upon the
filter and gradually dries to a horny mass.</p>

<p>Paste left to itself soon decomposes, especially during the
hot season of the year; it becomes sour through the formation
of lactic acid, butyric acid, acetic acid, and other substances,
and loses its adhesive power.</p>

<p>In preparing paste, the following rules must be especially
observed: Divide the starch in water by constant stirring
so as to form a homogeneous, rather thinly liquid fluid, and
then add boiling water in small portions, stirring constantly.
The conversion of the starch into paste is recognized by the
thickening of the entire mass and the appearance of opalescence,
when it is only necessary to add the required quantity
of water to give the paste the desired consistency.</p>

<p>If white lumps are observed, it is an indication that the
starch has not been thoroughly mixed with the water, and
that certain portions of it have remained dry. Paste containing
such lumps cannot be applied with any degree of
uniformity, and besides it possesses less adhesive power.
Nothing can be done to remedy the evil except diluting the
paste with a considerable quantity of water and boiling,
with constant stirring, until the mass is perfectly homogenous.</p>

<p>Starch paste prepared in a proper manner possesses great
adhesive power, and, when applied in a thin layer, dries to
an almost colorless coating. Pure starch paste is used for
many purposes. It serves not only for pasting paper, wall
paper, etc., but also for sizing tissues, such as paper-muslin,
linen, etc., in order to give them lustre, body, and, under
certain circumstances, greater weight. To increase the
weight of linen, white lead or heavy spar is frequently
mixed with the starch.</p>

<p><i>Flour paste.</i> The principal constituent of flour, besides
starch, is gluten. It is obtained in a pure state by tying
flour in a linen bag and kneading it under water so long
as the latter is rendered turbid by particles of starch. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
gluten remaining in the bag is a light-brown, very tenacious
mass, drawing threads between the fingers, and, as regards
its chemical properties, is closely allied to albumen and
caseine. Gluten, like the last-mentioned substances, shows
a tendency to form combinations with lime which gradually
solidify, and it can therefore be used for preparing cements.
Like albumen and caseine, it speedily putrefies if exposed
to the air in a moist state, and in decomposing forms products
which have a very unpleasant odor.</p>

<p>Flour paste is prepared in precisely the same manner as
starch paste, but while the latter is white, flour paste, even
if prepared from the best wheat flour, has always a yellow-brown
color. As regards adhesive power it is superior to
starch paste, but is less durable.</p>

<p>There are many means to prevent the spoiling of paste.
With paste once dry and kept so, there is no danger of
spoiling, but if it is alternately exposed to dampness and
dryness, as for instance with wall-paper hung on walls not
entirely dry, decomposition will unavoidably take place,
and the wall paper will become spotted and fall off the wall.</p>

<p>Provided either starch or flour paste is protected against
drying in, it can be kept unchanged for a long time by the
addition of a small quantity of carbolic acid.</p>

<p>For hanging wall-paper an addition of alum is, generally
speaking, more suitable than carbolic acid.</p>

<p>In hanging wall-paper the wall is generally first sized
with glue water. By the alum coming in contact with glue
an insoluble leather-like combination is formed, which not
only resists decomposition, but by far surpasses ordinary
paste as regards adhesive power, so that when the paper is
to be removed from the wall it has to be scraped and torn
off in small pieces, while that hung without previous sizing
of the wall is readily removed in large pieces.</p>

<p>But alum cannot be used for preserving a glue solution,
as it would cause it to coagulate to a flaky mass. Carbolic
acid is, on the other hand, an excellent means for the pur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>pose,
but to prevent its characteristic empyreumatic odor
from making itself too sensibly felt, no more than about
one two-thousandth of the weight of the glue solution should
be added.</p>

<p><i>Shoemakers’ paste.</i> In addition to being cheap, no other
paste adheres as well to leather as the so-called shoemakers’
paste. With it leather can be secured not only to leather,
but also to woven materials, paper, etc. Though its preparation
is very simple, it is connected with some disagreeable
features consisting chiefly in the development of a truly
terrible stench.</p>

<p>The paste is prepared by stirring crushed barley with
hot water to a thick paste and adding small portions of hot
water, so that the temperature of the mass is kept at between
86° to 104° F. In a few days the mass commences to
develop gas, which shows at first no odor, but soon the
development of gas becomes stronger and an acid odor is
perceptible, which in a short time is replaced by a terrific
stench which, as before mentioned, affects the olfactory
organs in a most unpleasant manner.</p>

<p>In consequence of the acid and putrid fermentation the
pasty mass gradually loses its granular condition, and is
finally converted into a homogeneous, thickly fluid mass of
a brown color, which draws threads between the fingers,
and possesses great adhesive power. When this is the case,
decomposition, which otherwise would go on until nothing
remained but a watery and acid fluid, is interrupted by
lowering the temperature of the paste by ladling it from the
vat or by adding a small quantity of carbolic acid.</p>

<p>To render the stench developed during the fermentation
of the paste innoxious, the vat in which it is prepared
should be provided with a well-fitting cover, in which is
fitted a stovepipe passing into a chimney connected with a
kitchen range or furnace, in which a fire is frequently burnt.</p>

<p>By kneading shoemaker’s paste together with indifferent
substances it can be used as a cement for various purposes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
The substances best adapted for the purpose are burnt lime
slaked to a powder, whiting, zinc white, pipe clay, ochre, etc.</p>

<p><i>Gum arabic.</i> This gum is an exudation from certain
tropical species of acacia, and consists essentially of arabine,
which has the composition C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>11</sub>O<sub>11</sub>. The best gum
arabic is that in the form of very pale-yellow, brittle pieces;
golden-yellow to brownish pieces are not valued as highly,
though they give a solution of considerable adhesive power.</p>

<p>Gum arabic dissolves in water, but not in alcohol, and
therefore can not be employed for cements in the preparation
of which solutions of resins in spirit of wine are to be
used.</p>

<p>There are other products of vegetable life, which are also
in commerce, called gums, but dissolve partly in spirit of
wine. To this class belongs the gum ammoniac mentioned
in some receipts for cements. As it is rather expensive, it
is seldom used by itself as a cement.</p>

<p><i>Dextrine</i> is extensively used in place of gum arabic in
printing wall-papers, for stiffening and glazing cards and
paper, for thickening the colors of calico printers, in making
mucilages, etc. It is prepared by heating starch previously
moistened with nitric acid in an oven, and can also
be produced by heating paste with malt extract or very
dilute sulphuric acid. There is a current anecdote which
attributes the discovery of dextrine to a conflagration at a
starch factory where one of the workmen who assisted in
quenching the fire observed the gummy properties of the
water which had been thrown over the torrefied starch.</p>

<p>Commercial dextrine forms pale-yellow to dark-brown
masses. These masses dissolve readily in water, and form
solutions which, as regards adhesive power, compare favorably
with those prepared from gum arabic. The mucilage
is prepared by simply stirring the pulverized dextrine with
water to a thickly-fluid liquid.</p>

<p>To preserve mucilage unchanged for any length of time,
and to prevent the disagreeable formation of mould upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
its surface, it is recommended to dissolve some salicylic acid
in the water to be used for preparing the mucilage.</p>

<p>Dextrine is usually prepared on a large scale by moistening
10 parts of starch with 3 parts of water acidulated with 1/100
part of nitric acid. The mixture is allowed to dry, and is
then spread upon trays in layers about three-quarters of an
inch deep in an oven, where it is heated for about one hour
to 239° F. Sometimes large drums revolving over a fire
are used, or, in order to keep up a uniform temperature, the
starch is placed in a copper cylinder suspended in a vessel
with oil which is heated to 356° F. The object of the addition
of nitric acid is to allow the starch to be converted
into dextrine at a temperature which would be inadequate
to effect the transformation of starch alone.</p>

<p>Dextrine is also frequently prepared by allowing germinated
barley or malt to act upon starch. Heat 350 to 400
parts of water to about 77° F., and after adding 5 to 10
parts of dry malt, raise the temperature to 140° F. Then
add 100 parts of starch, and after mixing the whole thoroughly
together, raise the temperature to about 158° F. for
twenty minutes. The mass, which appears at first milky
and sticky, will gradually become as liquid as water by the
conversion of the starch into gum through the action of the
malt. To prevent the conversion of the gum into sugar by
the diastase of the malt, the fluid must be quickly brought
to the boiling-point, and, after cooling, filtered and evaporated
to the consistency of syrup. In cooling, the mass gelatinizes
to a jelly, which after drying is hard and brittle.</p>

<p>According to Blumenthal’s method, a drum which can
be hermetically closed, is filled two-thirds full with dry
starch flour by means of a funnel. A stirring apparatus is
then set in motion, and the acid which is contained in a
graduated cylinder is sprayed into the drum by means of a
special contrivance.</p>

<p>In a drum 5 feet long and 3¼ feet in diameter, 220 lbs.
of potato starch can be uniformly mixed in 5 minutes with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
about 9 ozs. of nitric acid of 40° B., and the drum emptied
by opening the slide. Starch thus treated may be brought
into the oven without previous drying.</p>

<p>Heuzé gives the following method: Four and a half
pounds of nitric acid of 1.4 specific gravity together with
300 quarts of water are mixed with 2,200 lbs. of starch, and
boiled to form a mass which, when exposed to the air becomes
dry. It is sometimes effected at 177° F., but it
becomes a paste at 212° to 230° F. The starch changes
into dextrine in an hour or an hour and a half at the most;
it is white and soluble in water.</p>

<p><i>Tragacanth, or gum tragacanth</i>, exudes from <i>Astragalus
verus</i>, a tree indigenous to Asia. The term gum is a misnomer,
as tragacanth does not actually dissolve in water
nor in spirit of wine, but merely swells up in water to a soft
gelatinous mass. Tragacanth consists of irregular pieces of
a pure white to yellowish color. It is chiefly used for confectioner’s
purposes, though sometimes as a paste for fancy
articles. This variety of gum is found, together with
arabine, in the gum which exudes from cherry, plum,
almond, and apricot trees, and gives the mucilaginous character
to the watery decoctions prepared from certain seeds,
such as linseed and quince-seed, and from the root of
marshmallow.</p>


<h4>PASTES AND MUCILAGES FOR SPECIAL PURPOSES.</h4>

<p><i>Starch paste.</i> Corn starch 8 ozs., cold water ½ pint, boiling
water 1 gallon.</p>

<p>Beat up the starch in the cold water until reduced to a
creamy consistence, then pour the mixture into the boiling
water and stir briskly until the white, semi-opaque mass,
becomes transparent. Should it fail to do so, place it over
the fire, and boil until the desired result is obtained, stirring
constantly.</p>

<p><i>Flour paste.</i> Wheat flour 4 lbs., cold water 2 quarts,
alum 2 ozs., hot water ½ pint, boiling water 2 gallons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

<p>Work the wheat flour into a batter free from lumps with
the cold water. Dissolve the alum in the hot water. Then
stir the batter into the boiling water, and if necessary, continue
boiling until the paste thickens into a semi-transparent
mucilage, after which stir in the alum solution. This
makes a very fine paste for wall-paper.</p>

<p><i>Strong adhesive paste.</i> Rye flour 2 lbs., cold water 1
quart, boiling water 3 quarts, pulverized rosin 1 oz.</p>

<p>Make the flour into a batter with the cold water, free
from lumps, and pour into the boiling water. Boil, if
necessary, and while hot stir in the pulverized rosin, a
little at a time. This paste is very strong, and will fasten
heavy wall-paper or thin leather. If too thick, thin with
hot water. Never thin paste with cold water.</p>

<p><i>Paste that will not sour.</i> Allow 4 parts by weight of glue
to soften in 15 parts of cold water for some hours, and then
heat moderately till the solution becomes quite clear; then
add, while stirring, 65 parts of boiling water. In another
vessel stir up 30 parts of starch paste with 20 parts of cold
water, so that a thin, milky fluid without lumps is obtained.
Into this pour the boiling glue solution, stirring constantly,
and keep the whole at the boiling temperature. After cooling,
add 5 to 10 drops of carbolic acid to the paste. Preserve
the paste in closed bottles to prevent evaporation of
the water. It will thus keep good for years.</p>

<p><i>Venetian paste.</i> White or fish glue 4 ozs., cold water ½
pint, Venice turpentine 2 fluid ozs., rye flour 1 lb., cold
water 1 pint, boiling water 2 quarts.</p>

<p>Soak the 4 ozs. of glue in the cold water for 4 hours.
Dissolve over a water-bath, and while hot stir in the Venice
turpentine. Make up the rye flour into a batter free from
lumps with the pint of water, and pour the latter into the
boiling water. Stir briskly, and finally add the glue solution.
This makes a very strong paste, and it will adhere
to a painted surface, owing to the Venice turpentine in its
composition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>

<p><i>Label paste.</i> A good paste for attaching labels to bottles
may be made by soaking glue in strong vinegar, then heat
to boiling and add flour. This is very adhesive, and will
not decompose when kept in wide-mouthed bottles.</p>

<p><i>Elastic or pliable paste.</i> Starch 4 ozs., white dextrine 2
ozs., cold water 10 fluid ozs., borax 1 oz., glycerine 3 fluid
ozs., boiling water 2 quarts.</p>

<p>Beat the starch and dextrine into paste with the cold
water. Dissolve the borax in the boiling water, then add
the glycerine, and pour the starch and dextrine mixture
into the borax solution. Stir until it becomes translucent.
This paste will not crack, and, being very pliable, is suitable
for paper, cloth, leather and other material where
flexibility is required.</p>

<p><i>Mucilage for labels.</i> Macerate 5 parts of good glue in 20
parts of water for 24 hours, and to the liquid add 9 parts of
rock candy, and 3 parts of gum arabic. The mixture may
be brushed upon paper while lukewarm. It keeps well,
does not stick together and adheres firmly to bottles.</p>

<p><i>Mucilage.</i> A strong aqueous solution of dextrine forms a
most adhesive and cheap mucilage. Dilute alcohol is
usually employed as the solvent where the mucilage is to
be used for gumming envelopes, postage stamps, etc., and in
order to facilitate the drying, acetic acid is added to increase
the mobility of the fluid. The strong aqueous solution
is more adhesive than that prepared with alcohol, for
the reason that it contains a greater proportion of dextrine.</p>

<p>To prepare this add an excess of dextrine to boiling
water, stir for a minute or two, allow to cool and settle, and
strain the liquid through a cloth. The addition of a little
powdered sugar increases the glossiness of the dried gum.
The sugar should be dissolved in the water before the dextrine
is added.</p>

<p><i>According to another formula</i>, dextrine is mixed with hot
water until a syrupy liquid is obtained. Then add a few
drops of oil of cloves, and cool for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span></p>

<p><i>Another formula is as follows</i>: Dextrine 120 parts, powdered
alum 6, sugar 30, carbolic acid 1, water 300. Mix gradually
the dextrine, alum and sugar with the water, boil to
effect solution, and when cold, add the carbolic acid.</p>

<p>The solubility of dextrine may be enhanced by the addition
of a calcium salt readily soluble in water, the resulting
mixture dissolving with ease in cold water. Calcium
nitrate has proved especially suitable for the purpose. By
pouring 1 quart of water over a mixture of 18 ozs. of dextrine
and 7 ozs. of calcium nitrate, a mass of great adhesive
power is immediately obtained.</p>

<p><i>Mucilage for postage stamps.</i> Dextrine 2 parts, acetic acid
1, water 5, alcohol 1. Mix all together.</p>

<p><i>Caseine mucilage.</i> Take the curd of skim milk, wash it
thoroughly, and dissolve it to saturation in a cold concentrated
solution of borax.</p>

<p><i>Tragacanth mucilage.</i> Powdered tragacanth 2 drachms,
glycerine 12 drachms, water enough to make 20 ozs.</p>

<p>Put the tragacanth in a mortar with the glycerine, and
then add the water. This will produce at once a mucilage
of excellent quality.</p>

<p><i>Adhesive paste.</i> Steep 4 ozs. of ordinary gelatine in
16 ozs. of water until it becomes soft, then dissolve it by the
heat of a water bath, and while still hot pour into a mixture
of 2 lbs. of good flour paste and 1 part of water. Heat
the whole to boiling and when thickened remove from the
fire. While cooling add 6 drachms of silicate of soda and
stir the mixture with a wooden spatula. This preparation
will keep good for an indefinite period, and is very adhesive.
The addition of 2 drachms of oil of cloves is an improvement.</p>

<p><i>Fluid pastes.</i> I. Gum arabic 10 lbs., sugar 2 lbs., nitric
acid 1¾ ozs., water as required.</p>

<p>Dissolve the gum and sugar in the water, then add the
acid and heat to the boiling-point. The resulting paste is
liquid, does not mould, and dries to a transparent layer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
upon paper. It is especially suitable for flaps of envelopes,
fine bookbinders’ work, etc.</p>

<p>II. Potato starch 10 lbs., water 5 quarts, nitric acid 8 ozs.</p>

<p>Mix the acid and water and pour it on the starch in an
earthenware basin, put the latter in a warm place, and
allow it to remain 24 hours, with occasional stirring. Then
boil it until it becomes thickly-fluid and very transparent.
If necessary it should be diluted with water and filtered
through a cloth.</p>

<p><i>Sugar and lime paste.</i> Dissolve 12 parts of white sugar in
36 of water. Heat the solution to the boiling-point and
add 3 parts of slaked lime. Allow the liquid to stand in a
covered vessel for several days, stirring frequently and,
when settled, pour off the supernatant thick fluid from the
excess of lime.</p>

<p>The paste thus obtained has all the properties of gum
arabic solution and dries to a lustrous mass.</p>

<p><i>Liquid sugar and lime paste.</i> Allow 3 parts of glue to
swell in 10 to 15 parts of the foregoing paste. Heat the
mixture to the boiling-point. The paste thus obtained does
not congeal on cooling and possesses considerable adhesive
power.</p>

<p>By reason of its caustic properties, due to the content of
lime, this paste should not be used for pasting colored
materials.</p>

<p><i>Pastes for paper and fine fancy articles.</i> I. Dissolve, with
the assistance of heat, 100 parts of gilder’s glue in 200 of
water, and add a solution of 2 parts of bleached shellac in
10 of alcohol.</p>

<p>II. Dissolve, with the assistance of heat, 50 parts of dextrine
in 50 of water, stir solutions 1 and 2 together, strain
through a cloth into a flat prismatic mould, and allow it to
congeal. For use, melt a piece of corresponding size, and
dilute the liquid, if necessary, with water.</p>

<p><i>Albumen paste.</i> This is a misnomer, as it contains no
albumen. It is partly decayed gluten from flour, washed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
with water and then heated to 60° or 68° F., when it ferments
and becomes partly fluid. It is then dried at 77° to
86° F., and is claimed to keep any length of time in a dry
place. Dissolved in twice its weight of water it can be used
as a paste for all purposes.</p>

<p><i>Glycerine paste.</i> Dissolve 2 ozs. of gum arabic and 4
drachms of glycerine in 6 ozs. of boiling water. This is a
good paste for office use.</p>

<p><i>Paste for fixing labels on machines.</i> Make a paste of rye
flour and glue and add to every pound thereof ½ oz. each of
boiled linseed oil and turpentine. This paste resists damp
and thus prevents printed labels from falling off metallic
surfaces.</p>

<p><i>Paste for mounting maps.</i> Stiff rye flour paste is best for
this purpose.</p>

<p><i>Paste for fastening paper on tin-foil.</i> Make a paste by dissolving
rye flour in solution of caustic soda; dilute with
water, stirring all the time. Add to this paste a few drops
of Venice turpentine for each ½ lb. of flour.</p>

<p><i>Paste for paper bags.</i> Add to 3 parts of starch 24 to 30
parts of cold water. Stir together to a homogeneous mass
of about the thickness of syrup. Pour over this, stirring
constantly, boiling water until the paste is of the required
consistency. Stir until nearly cold. Take a portion of the
paste and add to it 6 to 15 per cent. liquefied Venice turpentine;
rub together until a kind of emulsion is formed,
then mix the whole together and work thoroughly.</p>

<p><i>Caseine mucilage for photographer’s use.</i> Separate the
caseine from milk by means of a little tartaric acid, and
treat the caseine while still warm with a solution of 6 parts
of borax to 100 parts water, and warm gently while stirring
which will cause the caseine to be dissolved. Of the borax
solution enough should be used to leave only a little undissolved
caseine behind.</p>

<p><i>Paste for scrap-books.</i> Rice starch 1 oz., gelatine 3
drachms, water ½ pint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span></p>

<p>Heat, stirring constantly, until the milky fluid becomes
thick and gluey. When the paste is nearly thick put in a
bottle closely corked. It is well to add a few drops of oil
of cloves to each bottle.</p>

<p><i>Paste for skins.</i> Pour enough boiling water over 1 lb. of
rye flour in a basin to make a stiff paste, almost as stiff as
ordinary dough for puddings. Stir and beat up well with
a stick for three or four minutes, then cover up and let it
stand for two days before using, when it will be much softer
and stick better. Spread thinly and evenly on the back of
the skin with a stiff brush or pad. It will stick firmly and
not crack.</p>

<p><i>Strong mucilage</i> capable of fastening wood or china and
glass together is made of 3½ ozs. of strong gum arabic solution,
to which a solution of 30 grains of sulphate of aluminium
dissolved in ⅔ oz. of water is added.</p>

<p><i>Dextrine mucilage.</i> I. Dissolve with the assistance of heat
60 parts of borax in 420 parts of water, add 480 parts of
pale yellow dextrine and 50 parts of glucose, and heat carefully,
stirring constantly until solution is complete, replacing
the water lost by evaporation. Strain through flannel.</p>

<p>The resulting mucilage is quite clear, has great adhesive
power, and dries very quickly. In heating the mixture,
great care should be exercised not to exceed a temperature
of 194° F. and not to heat too long, otherwise the product
readily becomes brown and brittle.</p>

<p>II. Dextrine 120 parts, powdered alum 6, sugar 30, carbolic
acid 1, distilled water 300. Gradually mix the dextrine,
alum and sugar with the water, effect solution by
boiling and when the solution is cold, add the carbolic acid.</p>

<p><i>Paste for joining leather to pasteboard.</i> Dissolve 50 parts
of strong glue with a little water at a gentle heat, then add
a small quantity of Venice turpentine, and next a thick
paste made with 100 parts of starch in water. Apply
quickly when cold.</p>

<p><i>Another formula</i> for a similar paste is as follows: Rye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
whisky 2 pints, water 1 pint, powdered starch 4¼ ozs., good
glue 1¼ ozs., Venice turpentine 1¼ ozs. Mix the whisky
and water together, then stir in the starch and make a thick
paste. Separately dissolve the glue in an equal weight of
water, and mix the Venice turpentine therein, mix thoroughly,
and then compound this mixture with the thick
paste by constantly stirring until all is well incorporated.</p>

<p><i>Paste for attaching labels to polished nickel.</i> Dissolve 400
parts by weight of dextrine in 600 parts of water, and add
20 parts of glycerine and 10 parts of glucose. Heat the
mixture to 194° F.</p>

<p><i>Another formula</i> is as follows: Mix 400 parts by weight
of dextrine with water, and add 200 parts of water together
with 20 parts of glucose and 10 parts of aluminium sulphate.</p>

<p><i>Mucilage for attaching labels to tin.</i> I. Shellac 8 parts,
borax 4 parts, water 60 parts. Boil until the shellac is
dissolved.</p>

<p>II. To 2 parts of dammar varnish add 8 parts of tragacanth
mucilage.</p>

<p>III. An excellent mucilage for the purpose consists of
starch paste to which a small quantity of Venice turpentine
has been added.</p>

<p>IV. Make a paste of corrosive sublimate 2½ parts, wheat
flour 200, absinthe 100, tansy 50, water 3000. This mucilage
is useful for vessels kept in a damp place.</p>

<p><i>Mucilage for office use.</i> Gum arabic 100 parts, aluminium
sulphate 6 parts, glycerine 10, dilute acetic acid 20, distilled
water 140. Dissolve, in a wide-mouthed glass bottle, the
gum arabic in cold distilled water, stirring frequently. Let
the solution stand 2 or 3 days, then add the glycerine, later
on the dilute acetic acid and finally the aluminium sulphate.
Strain through a hair sieve, allow to clarify, and
decant from the sediment.</p>

<p><i>Glycerine paste for office use.</i> Dissolve 4 ozs. of gum arabic
and 8 drachms of glycerine in 12 ozs. of boiling water.</p>

<p><i>Clean and durable paste.</i> Dissolve 5 ozs. of gum arabic in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
4 quarts of warm water, and thicken to a paste with wheat
flour. Then add a solution of alum and sugar of lead,
3 ozs. of each in water. Heat the mixture and stir it until
it is about to boil, and then cool it. If too thick, add gum
solution.</p>

<p><i>Banknote or mouth glue.</i> Dissolve by the aid of heat a
fine quality of glue or gelatine with about a quarter or one-third
of its weight of brown sugar, in as small a quantity of
water as possible. Then when perfectly liquid cast the
mixture into thin cakes on a flat surface very slightly oiled,
and when cold cut up into pieces of convenient size. When
required for use moisten one end. A piece of this glue
kept in the desk will be found very convenient for many
purposes.</p>

<p><i>Paste for cardboard.</i> Dissolve 3½ ozs. of best French glue
in 6½ ozs. of water by soaking and heating. Then add a
solution of ½ drachm of shellac in 3½ drachms of alcohol
and stir as long as the solution is warm. Next dissolve 2
drachms of dextrine in 1¾ ozs. of alcohol and 14 drachms
of water, stir, and place the vessel in warm water until solution
is complete. Mix this solution with that of the glue,
and pour the whole into a suitable vessel, in which it may
solidify. When wanted for use cut off a small piece and
liquefy it by warming.</p>

<p><i>Paste for attaching cloth or leather to table tops.</i> Wheat
flour 1 lb., powdered rosin 2 tablespoonfuls, powdered alum
1 tablespoonful. Heat and stir to a stiff consistency.</p>

<p><i>Caseine mucilage.</i> Separate the caseine from milk with a
little tartaric acid, and treat the caseine while still warm
with a solution of 6 parts borax to 100 parts water and warm
gently while stirring, which will cause the caseine to be dissolved.
Of the borax solution enough should be used to
leave only a little undissolved caseine behind.</p>

<p><i>Very adhesive paste which may be used for wood and parchment.</i>
Gum arabic 60 parts, fine wheat starch 45, sugar 15.
Dissolve the gum in as much water as is required for boil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>ing
the quantity of paste to be made. Then add the starch
and sugar and boil it in a vessel suspended in boiling water
until the mixture is clear and has the consistency of liquid
tar. Keep in a well-closed vessel protected from mould by
the addition of a few drops of oil of cloves.</p>

<p><i>Paste for pads.</i> Glue 4 parts by weight, glycerine 2, linseed
oil ½, sugar 4, aniline dye sufficient to color. Soften
the glue by soaking in cold water, then dissolve together
with the sugar in the glycerine by the aid of heat over the
water-bath, then add the dye and stir in the oil. Use the
paste hot.</p>

<p><i>Paste for fastening paper on tin-foil.</i> Make a paste by dissolving
rye flour in a solution of caustic soda; dilute with
water, stirring constantly. Add to this paste a few drops
of Venice turpentine for each ½ lb. flour used. This paste
adheres to all kinds of metal, tin-foil, glass, etc.</p>

<p><i>Paste for attaching labels to glass, porcelain, and metal.</i>
Gum arabic 15 parts, pulverized tragacanth 7½, glycerin
45, thymol 0.3, alcohol 3¾, water 120. Dissolve the gum
arabic in 15 parts of water and triturate the tragacanth
with 30 parts of water. Mix the two fluids and strain.
Then add the glycerine and finally the thymol dissolved in
the alcohol.</p>

<p><i>Preparation of arabol-gum.</i> Mix intimately 44 lbs. of
wheat starch with 176 lbs. of water. Bring the mass into
a water-bath, mix it with a solution of 4.4 lbs. of oxalic
acid in 44 lbs. of water and heat for four hours at 194° F.,
stirring frequently. The conversion of the starch is as a
rule effected during this time, but should such not be the
case, continue heating, constantly replacing the evaporated
water, until the mass is clear and liquid. While still hot,
neutralize the mass with marble dust, allow to settle, filter,
and evaporate the clear solution in a water-bath to a solid
gum containing about 15 per cent. of water.</p>

<p><i>Preparation of an adhesive substance from desaccharized beet-root
slices</i> (German patent 96316 f. G. Eichelbaum). The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
insoluble metarabin contained in the slices is converted
into soluble arabin by treating the slices under pressure
with hot aqueous sulphurous acid or with aqueous solutions
of the bisulphites of the alkalies or alkaline earths.</p>

<p>According to a later patent (German patent 121422 f.
Fabrik Bettenhausen Marquart and Schulz), the insoluble
metarabin is converted into soluble arabin by heating the
desaccharized beet-root slices with phosphoric acid and
water. According to a supplement to this patent (122048),
conversion is effected by heating the slices with aqueous
solutions of organic acids and phenols, or the acid salts of
oxalic, tartaric or phosphoric acids.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
